      "text": "The body of the os humeri becomes gradually broader towards the lower end, where it has several processes; at the roots of which there is a cavity before, and another behind. The anterior is divided, by a ridge, into two; the external, which is the least, receives the end of the radius; and the internal receives the coronoid process of the ulna in the flexion of the fore-arm, while the posterior deep triangular cavity lodges the olecranon in the extensions of that member.\u2014The sides of\nthe posterior cavity are stretched out into two processes, one on each side: These are called condyles; from each of which a strong ligament goes out to the bones of the fore-arm.\u2014The external condyle, which has an oblique direction also forwards in respect of the internal, when the arm is in the most natural posture, is equally broad, and has an obtuse smooth head rising from it forwards.\u2014From the rough part of the condyle, the inferior head of the bicipitis, the extensor digitorum communis, extensor carpi ulnaris, anconeus, and some part of the supinator radii brevis, take their rise; and on the smooth head the upper end of the radius plays.\u2014Immediately on the outside of this, there is a sinuosity made by the shorter head of the bicipitis muscle, upon which the muscular nerve is placed.\u2014The internal condyle is more pointed and protuberant than the external, to give origin to some part of the flexor carpi radialis, pronator radii teres, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum sublimis, and flexor carpi ulnaris.\u2014Between the two condyles, is the trochlea or pully, which consists of two lateral protuberances, and a middle cavity, that are smooth, and covered with cartilage.\u2014When the fore-arm is extended, the tendon of the internal brachioradialis muscle is lodged in the fore-part of the cavity of this pully.\u2014The external protuberance, which is less than the other, has a sharp edge behind; but forwards, this ridge is obtuse, and only separated from the little head, already described, by a small fossa, in which the joined edges of the ulna and radius move.\u2014The internal protuberance of the pully is largest and highest; and therefore, in the motions of the ulna upon it, that bone would be inclined outwards, was it not supported by the radius on that side.\u2014Between this internal protuberance and condyle, a sinuosity may be remarked, where the ulnar nerve passes. The round head at the upper end of this bone is articulated with the glenoid cavity of the scapula; which being superficial, and having long ligaments, allows the arm a free and extensive motion.",

      "text": "On Original Composition. The mind of a man of genius is a fertile and pleasant field; pleasant as Elysium, and fertile as Tempe; it enjoys a perpetual spring. Of that spring, originals are the fairest flowers; imitations are of quicker growth, but fainter bloom. Imitations are of two kinds; one of nature, one of author's: the first we call originals, and confine the term imitation to the second. We shall not enter into the curious inquiry of what is, or is not, strictly speaking, original, content with what all must allow, that some compositions are more so than others; and the more they are so, the better. Originals are, and ought to be, great favourites, for they are benefactors; they extend the republic of letters, and add a new province to its dominion: imitators only give us a sort of duplicates of what we had, possibly much better, before; increasing the mere drug of books, while all that makes them valuable, knowledge and genius, are at a stand. The pen of an original writer, like Armida's wand, out of a barren wattle calls a blooming spring: out of that blooming spring an imitator is a transplanter of laurels, which sometimes die on removal, always languish in a foreign soil. But suppose an imitator to be most excellent (and such there are), yet still he but nobly builds on another's foundation; his debt is, at least, equal to his glory; which therefore, on the balance, cannot be very great. On the contrary, an original, though but indifferent (its originality being set aside), yet has something to boast; it is something to say with him in Horace,\n\nMeo sum pauper in ore;\n\nand to share ambition with no less than Caesar, who declared he had rather be the first in a village, than the second at Rome. Still farther: an imitator shares his crown, if he has one, with the chosen object of his imitation; an original enjoys an undivided applause. An original may be said to be of a vegetable nature; it rises spontaneously from the vital root of genius; it grows, it is not made: imitations are often a sort of manufacture wrought by those mechanics, art and labour, out of pre-existent materials not their own. Again: we read imitation with somewhat of his languor who listens to a twice-told tale: our spirits roufe at an original; that is a perfect stranger, and all throng to learn what news from a foreign land: and though it comes, like an Indian prince, adorned with feathers only, having little of weight; yet of our attention it will rob the more solid, if not equally new: thus every telescope is lifted at a new-discovered star; it makes a hundred astronomers in a moment, and denies equal notice to the sun. But if an original, by being as excellent, as new, adds admiration to surprize, then are we at the writer's mercy; on the strong wing of his imagination, we are snatched from Britain to Italy, from climate to climate, from pleasure to pleasure; we have no home, no thought, of our own; till the magician drops his pen: and then falling down into ourselves, we awake to flat realities, lamenting the change, like the beggar who dreamt himself a prince. It is with thoughts, as it is with words; and with both, as with men; they may grow old and die. Words tarnished, by passing through the mouths of the vulgar, are laid aside as inelegant and obsolete. So thoughts, when become too common, should lose their currency; and we should send new metal to the mint, that is, new meaning to the press. The division of tongues at Babel did not more effectually debar men from making themselves a name (as the scripture speaks) than the too great concurrence or union of tongues will do for ever. We may as well grow good by another's virtue, or fat by another's food, as famous by another's thought.",

      "text": "the difficulty of distinguishing between obstructions and pregnancy in the first months, is so great, that we ought to be cautious in giving our opinion; and never prescribe such remedies as may endanger the fruit of the womb; but rather endeavour to palliate the complaints, until time shall discover the nature of the case; and always judge on the charitable side, when life or reputation is at stake. In the fifth or sixth month of uterine gestation, by the touch in the vagina, we perceive the neck of the womb considerably shortened, and the stretching of the lower part of the uterus is then sensibly felt between the mouth of the womb and the pubes, and on each side of the neck. See Plate CXL fig. 3. In the seventh month, the head of the child is frequently felt resting against the lower part of the uterus, between the pubes and os internum; and being pushed upwards towards the fundus, sinks down again by its own gravity. All these diagnostics are more plain and certain, the nearer the patient approaches to the time of delivery. Sometimes, the head is not felt till the eighth or ninth month; and in some few cases, not till after the membranes are broke, when it is forced down by the contraction of the uterus, and strong labour-pains. This circumstance may be owing to the head's resting above the basin, especially in a narrow pelvis; or to the diffusion of its belly with air after death, by which the fetus being rendered specifically lighter than the surrounding waters, the body floats up to the fundus, if there is a large quantity of fluid in the membranes; nor is the body always felt when the child lies across the uterus. How to distinguish the false Labour from the true, and the means to be used on that occasion. If the os uteri remains close shut, it may be taken for granted that the woman is not yet in labour, notwithstanding the pains she may suffer; with regard to which, an accurate inquiry is to be made; and if her complaints proceed from an over stretching fullness of the uterus or vessels belonging to the neighbouring parts, bleeding in the arm or ankle, to the quantity of six or eight ounces, ought to be prescribed, and repeated occasionally. If the pains are occasioned by a loofenets or diarrhoea, it must be immediately restrained with opiates. Cholic pains are distinguished from those of labour, by being chiefly confined to the belly, without going off and returning by distinct intervals: they are for the most part produced by faeces too long retained in the colon, or by such ingesta as occasion a rarefaction or expansion of air in the intestines; by which they are violently stretched and vollicated. This complaint must be removed by opening glysters, to empty the guts of their noxious contents: and this evacuation being performed, opiates may be administered to afflague the paiss; either to be injected by the anus, taken by the mouth, or applied externally in form of epithem or embrocation. Sometimes, the os internum may be a little dilated, and yet it may be difficult to judge whether or not the patient be in labour; the case, however, may be ascertained, after some attendance, by these considerations: if the woman is not arrived at her full time; if no soft or glary mucus hath been discharged from the vagina; if the pains are limited to the region of the belly, without extending to the back and inside of the thighs; if they are slight, and continue without intermission or increase; nay, if they have long intervals, and recur without force sufficient to push down the waters and membranes, or child's head, to open the os internum; if this part be felt thick and rigid, instead of being soft, thin, and yielding; we may safely pronounce, that labour is not yet begun; and those alarms are to be removed as we have directed in the case of false or cholic pains. Besides, if the pulse be quick and strong, and the patient attacked by stitches in the sides, back, or head, bleeding will be likewise necessary.",

      "text": "This account might be sufficient to show the reader that Cardan was of a very fickle temper; but he will have a much better idea of his singular and odd turn of mind by examining what he himself has written concerning his own good and bad qualities. He paid himself congratulatory compliments for not having a friend in this world; but that, in requital, he was attended by an aerial spirit, emanated partly from Saturn and partly from Mercury, who was the constant guide of his actions, and teacher of every duty to which he was bound. He declared too, that he was so irregular in his manner of walking the streets, as induced all beholders to point at him as a fool. Sometimes he walked very slowly, like a man absorbed in profound meditation; then all on a sudden quickened his steps, accompanying them with very absurd attitudes. In Bologna his delight was to be drawn about in a mean vehicle with three wheels. When nature did not visit him with any pain, he would procure to himself that disagreeable sensation by biting his lips to wantonly, or pulling his fingers to such a vehement degree, as sometimes to force the tears from his eyes: and the reason he assigned for so doing, was to moderate certain impetuous fallies of the mind, the violence of which was to him by far more insupportable than pain itself; and that the sure consequence of such a severe discipline was the enjoying the pleasure of health. He says elsewhere, that, in his greatest tortures of soul, he used to whip his legs with rods, and bite his left arm; that it was a great relief to him to weep, but that very often he could not;\nthat nothing gave him more pleasure than to talk of things which made the whole company uneasy; that he spoke on all subjects, in season and out of season; and he was so fond of games of chance, as to spend whole days in them, to the great prejudice of his family and reputation, for he even flaked his furniture and his wife's jewels.\n\nCardanus makes no scruple of owning that he was revengeful, envious, treacherous, a dealer in the black art, a backbiter, a calumniator, and addicted to all the foul and detestable excesses that can be imagined: yet notwithstanding (as one would think) so humbling a declaration, there was never perhaps a vainer mortal, or one that with less ceremony expressed the high opinion he had of himself, than Cardanus was known to do, as will appear by the following proofs. \"I have been admired by many nations; an infinite number of panegyrics, both in prose and verse, have been composed to celebrate my fame. I was born to release the world from the manifold errors under which it groaned. What I have found out could not be discovered either by my predecessors or my contemporaries; and that is the reason why those authors who write anything worthy of being remembered, scruple not to own that they are indebted to me for it. I have composed a book on the dialectic art, in which there is neither one superfluous letter nor one deficient. I finished it in seven days, which seems a prodigy. Yet where is there a person to be found, that can boast of his having become master of its doctrine in a year? And that shall have comprehended it in that time, must appear to have been instructed by a familiar daemon.\"\n\n",

      "text": "With glafts of bismuth, and the simple and arsenicated glafts of lead, it forms opake milky compounds. By this property it is fitted for making the basis of the imperfect glafts called enamels (see Glass, and Enamel). The author of the Chemical Dictionary relates, that \"having exposed very pure tin, singly, to a fire as strong as that of a glasshouse furnace, during two hours, under a muffe, in an uncovered telft; and having then examined it, the metal was found covered with an exceedingly white calx, which appeared to have formed a vegetation; under this matter was a reddish calx, and an hyacinthine glaft; and lastly, at the bottom, was a piece of tin unaltered. The experiment was several times repeated with the same success.\"\n\nNitre deflagrates with tin, and hastens the calcination of this as well as of other imperfect metals. The vapours which rise from tin, by whatever method it is calcined, have generally an arsenical smell. Tin melted with arsenic falls in great part into a whitish calx; the part which remains uncalcined proves very brittle, appears of a white colour, and a sparkling plated texture, greatly resembling zinc. The arsenic is strongly retained by the tin, so as scarcely to be separable by any degree of fire; the tin always discovering, by its augmentation in weight, that it holds a portion of arsenic, though a very intense fire has been used. Hence, as the tin-ores abound in arsenic, the common tin is found also to participate of that mineral. Hennel discovered a method of separating actual Arsenic from tin; namely, by slowly dissolving the tin in eight times its quantity of an aqua regia made with fai ammoniae, and setting the solution to evaporate in a gentle warmth: the arsenic begins to concrete whilst the liquor continues hot, and more plentifully on its growing cold, into white crystals. Mr Margraaf, in the Berlin Memoirs for 1747, has given a more particular account of this process. He observes, that the white sediment which at first separates during the dissolution, is chiefly arsenical: that Malacca tin, which is accounted one of the purest sorts, yielded no less than \u00bc its weight of arsenical crystals; that some sorts yielded more; but that tin extracted from a particular kind of ore which contained no arsenic, afforded none. That the crystals were truly arsenical, appeared from their being totally volatile; from their subliming (a little fixed alkaline salt being added to absorb the acid) into a colourless pellucid concrete; from the sublimate, laid on a heated copper-plate, exhaling in fumes of a garlic smell; from its staining the copper white; and from its forming with sulphur, a compound similar to the yellow or sulphurated arsenic. He found that the arsenic was separable also by means of mercury: an amalgam of tin being long triturated with water, and the powder which was washed off committed to distillation, a little mercury came over, and bright arsenical flowers arose in the neck of the retort. Dr Lewis observes, that the cracking noise of tin in bending may possibly arise from its arsenic; observations as these operations which are said to separate arsenic from the metal, likewise deprives it of this property. Tin may be alloyed, in all proportions, with all metals by fusion: but it absolutely destroys their ductility, and renders them brittle, as in bell-metal; whence this metal has obtained the name of diabolus metallicus. It is remarkable, that the most ductile metals are most injured by the addition of a small quantity of tin; the vapour of a single grain of tin being sufficient to destroy the ductility of a considerable quantity of gold. Iron is dissolved by tin in a heat far less than that in which iron itself melts: the compound is white and brittle. Iron added to a mixture of lead and tin, takes up the tin, leaving the lead at the bottom; and, in like manner,\nmanner, if lead, tin, and silver are melted together, the addition of iron will absorb all the tin, and the tin only. Hence an easy method of purifying silver from tin. Not liable to rust. Tin, notwithstanding it is, like lead, soon deprived of its lustre by exposure to the air, is nevertheless much less liable to rust than either iron, copper, or lead; and hence is advantageously used for covering over the insides of other metallic vessels. The amalgam of mercury and tin is employed to cover one of the surfaces of looking-glasses; by which they are rendered capable of reflecting the rays of light. The amalgam also, mixed with sulphur and sal ammoniac, and let to sublimate, yields a sparkling gold-coloured substance called aurum mosaicum; which is sometimes used as a pigment. This preparation is commonly made from quicksilver and tin, of each two parts, amalgamated together; and then thoroughly mixed with sulphur and sal ammoniac, of each one part and a half. The mercury and sulphur unite into a cinnabar, which sublimes along with the sal ammoniac; and, after sublimation, the aurum mosaicum remains at the bottom. Sulphur may be united with tin by fusion; and forms with it a brittle mass, more difficultly fusible than pure tin. Sulphur has, in this respect, the same effect upon tin, as upon lead. The alloy of tin lessens the fusibility of these very fusible metals; while it increases the fusibility of other difficultly fusible metals, as iron and copper. 7.",

He observes, that it is the best basis of argument to begin from facts; and that if we can certainly find how some part of these animal remains come to be deposited at such great distances from their natural residence, we may very rationally conclude, that by the same means, be they what they will, all the rest were also brought thither. He adds, that the earth, once the bottom of the sea, or the level surface of a plain, may be, and frequently has been, in the memory of man, raised up into a mountain by subterranean fires, earthquakes, and volcanoes. He mentions the famous instance of the new island raised out of the bottom of the sea near Santorini in the year 1707, which became of a circumference not less than six miles, and of the new mountain raised near Pozzoli in 1538.\n\nThese, and many other like facts, prove that the origin of mountains and islands may have been such, and that the matter they consist of may have been the same with what was once the bottom of the sea; and that the marine bodies found in these mountains were such as were living, or remaining of living fish at the time when the islands or mountains were so raised above the surface of the water which before covered it.\n\nThis is no new opinion; but this author has set it in a new and much stronger light than it ever had appeared in before, by the instances and examples he has brought in proof of it. Some have been fond of believing that the bodies we call marine remains, were never indeed any parts of living animals, but that they are mere lusit nature formed in the places where they are found; but Fabius Columna proved this to be an error, showing that the shark's teeth, or globoptere of the island of Malta, when calcined by a strong fire, yielded ashes the same with those from animal bodies, and by no means of the same nature with those produced from calcined stones.\n\n",

      "text": "Constitutions disposed to frequent returns of intermittent fevers, seem likewise justly exceptionable; especially as the preparatory regimen may in some habits increase this tendency. Baron Dimsdale, however, has known instances of severeague-fits attacking persons between the infection of the matter and the eruption of the pox, and even during maturation, when the Peruvian bark has been given liberally and with much success; the principal benefits, in the mean time, suffering no injury or interruption. Among the circumstances generally considered as more or less propitious to inoculation, the season of the year has been reckoned a matter of some importance. Spring and autumn have been generally recommended, as being the most temperate seasons; the cold of winter, and the summer-heats, having been judged unfavourable for this purpose. But the Baron remarks, that experience does not justify those opinions; for, according to the best observation he has been able to make, inoculated persons have generally had more pustules in spring than at any other time of the year; and epidemic diseases being commonly most frequent in autumn, especially fluxes, intermittents, and ulcerated sore throats (all which are liable to mix more or less with the small-pox), the autumn, upon this account, does not seem to be the most favourable season in general. Our author's opinion is, that considering the surprising and indisputable benefits arising at all times to patients in the small-pox, from the free admission of fresh cool air and evacuations, we may safely inoculate at all seasons, provided care be taken to screen the patients as much as possible from heat in summer, and to prevent them from keeping themselves too warm and too much shut up, as they are naturally disposed to do, from the weather in winter. When seasons, however, are marked with any peculiar epidemics, of such a kind especially as may render a mild disease more untractable, it may perhaps be most prudent not to inoculate while such diseases are prevalent. In directing the preparatory regimen, Baron Dimsdale principally aims at the following points, viz. To reduce the patient, if in high health, to a lower and more secure state; to strengthen the constitution, if too low; to correct what appears vitiated; and to clear the stomach and bowels, as much as may be, from all crudities and their effects. With this view he orders such of his patients as constitute the first class abovementioned, and who are by much the majority, to live in the following manner: To abstain from all animal food, including broths, also butter and cheese; and\nand from all fermented liquors, excepting small beer, which is allowed sparingly; and from all spices, and whatever is endured with a manifest heating quality. The diet is to consist of pudding, gruel, fago, milk, rice-milk, fruit-pies, greens, roots, and vegetables of any of the kinds in season, prepared or raw. Eggs, though not to be eaten alone, are allowed in puddings, and butter in pye-crust. The patients are to be careful that they do not eat such a quantity as to overload their stomachs, even of this kind of food.",

It is impossible, say the objectors, to prove that there is in nature any substance which properly deserves the name of phlogiston, or sole principle of inflammability. We see that bodies are capable of being set on fire; but before we assume the existence of such a principle as phlogiston in the abstract, we ought to be able at least to define it, that so we might be able to prove its existence in different bodies. But, as matters stand at present, it is impossible for us even to know when we have gained our point. How is it possible, for instance, to know whether the phlogiston in spirit of wine be exactly the same with that in sulphur? Or, by what means can we be ascertained that it is the same principle which gives the splendor to metals that causes bodies emit a flame?\n\nTo this it may be replied, that philosophers in general have attributed all these phenomena to one cause: therefore every inquirer ought to search among Phlogiston the natural causes, in order to find one which is capable of producing all these phenomena; and if he finds such an one, there is the highest probability that there is no other; for nature does not multiply causes where one will serve. Hence it is incumbent on those who would assume two principles of inflammability, to prove the existence of them both; but there is not the same obligation upon those who assume the existence only of one to prove that no more exist.\n\n2. Though bodies may be inflamed, and have a predisposition to be inflamed in certain circumstances, we are not therefore bound to suppose that this predisposition consists in the admixture of any material substance with them.\n\nHere we must attend to the consequence of inflammation, which is a separation of the body into matter of two different kinds; one of which remains, while the other is carried off. As soon as this volatile matter is entirely dissipated, the inflammation ceases. The probability therefore is exceedingly strong, that this matter either is the principle of inflammability itself, or contains it.\n\n",

In composition, the author either confines himself, as a subject, to the mere mechanical modulations and arrangements of sound; and, as his end, to the pleasure of the ear alone; or otherwise he soars a nobler height; he aspires to imitative music; he endeavours to render the hearts and souls of his auditors ductile by his art, and thus to produce the noblest emotions and most salutary effects. In the first view, it is only necessary that he should look for beautiful sounds and agreeable chords; but in the second, he ought to consider music in its conformity with the accents of the human voice, and in the expressive powers of notes harmonically combined to signify or paint such objects as are susceptible of imitation. In Rousseau's article Opera, some ideas may be found by which the art may be ennobled and elevated, by forming music into a language more powerful and pathetic than eloquence itself. See Opera. Composition, in literature, the art of forming and arranging sentiments, and cloathing them with language suitable to the nature of the subject or discourse. See the articles Language, Oratory, Poetry, Dialogue, Epistle, and History. Composition, in chemistry, is the union and combination of several substances of different natures, from which a compound body results. From this union of bodies of different natures, a body is formed, of a mixed nature, which Becker and Stahl have called a mixture, and which may be called a combination, or chemical composition, to avoid the equivocal sense of the word mixture. By this last, we understand only a mere imposition of parts; and which would therefore give a very false idea of chemical composition, in which a mutual adhesion takes place between the combined substances. Composition, in painting, includes the invention as well as disposition of the figures, the choice of attitudes, &c. Composition, therefore, consists of two parts; one of which finds out, by means of history, proper objects for a picture; and the other disposes them to advantage. See Painting. Composition, in pharmacy, the art or act of mixing divers ingredients together into a medicine so as they may assist each other's virtues, supply each other's defects, or correct any ill qualities thereof. See Pharmacy. Composition, in commerce, a contract between an insolvent debtor and his creditors, whereby the latter accept of a part of the debt in composition for the whole, and give a general acquittance accordingly. Composition, in printing, commonly termed composing, the arranging of several types or letters in the compositing-stick, in order to form a line; and of several lines ranged in order, in the galley, to make a page; and of several pages to make a form.

Let the strength of the fire also be proportioned to the ponderosity of the oil intended to be raised with the spirit. 4. Let only a due proportion of the finest parts of the essential oil be united with the spirit; the groarser and less fragrant parts of the oil not giving the spirit so agreeable a flavour, and at the same time rendering it unsightly. This may in a great measure be effected by leaving out the faints, and making up to proof with fine soft water in their stead. A careful observation of these four rules will render this part of distillation much more perfect than it is at present. Nor will there be any occasion for the use of burnt alum, white of eggs, flinglass, &c. to fine down cordial waters; for they will presently be fine, sweet, and pleasant tasted, without any further trouble. We shall now subjoin particular receipts for making some of those compound waters, or spirits, that are most commonly to be met with, and are in the most general estimation. Strong Cinnamon-water. Take eight pounds of fine cinnamon bruised, 17 gallons of clean rectified spirit, a number and two gallons of water. Put them into your still, spirits, and digest them 24 hours with a gentle heat; after which draw off 16 gallons with a pretty strong heat. A cheaper spirit, but of an inferior quality, may be obtained by using cassia lignea instead of cinnamon. If you would dulcify your cinnamon water, take double-refined sugar in what quantity you please; the general proportion is about two pounds to a gallon; and dissolve it in the spirit, after you have made it up proof with clean water. One general caution is here necessary to be added; namely, that near the end of the operation, you carefully watch the spirit as it runs into the receiver, in order to prevent the faints from mixing with the goods. This you may discover by often catching some of it as it runs from the worm in a glass, and observing whether it is fine and transparent; for as soon as ever the faints begin to rise, the spirit will have an azure or bluish cast. As soon as this alteration\nDistillation in colour is perceived; the receiver must be immediately changed; for if the faints are suffered to mix themselves with the rest, the value of the goods will be greatly lessened.\u2014Here we may observe, that the distillers call such goods as are made up proof, double goods; and those below proof, single.

When it took up 80 seconds, for instance, in passing from the one bottle into the other, there was a difference of 5 hundredth-parts more than when it took up only 22 seconds, and about 2 hundredth-parts more than when it took up 45 seconds; but at other times the difference was less. As the hole in the plate Dd, however, was always the same in our author's experiments, the time taken up by the air in passing from one vessel into the other varied so little that no perceptible difference could arise from that cause. A greater difference arose from the size of the bottles and quality of the water made use of. When the small bottle, holding three measures, was used, and filled with distilled water, the diminution of common air was usually 1.08; but when the bottle was filled with water from the tub, it was .05 less. Using the bottle which held 12 measures, and filled with distilled water, the diminution was about 1.15; and with the same bottle filled with water from the tub it was usually 1.08. \"The reason of this (says Mr Cavendish) is, that water has the power of absorbing a small quantity of nitrous air; and the more phlogisticated the water is, the more of this air it can absorb. If the water is of such a nature as to froth or form bubbles on letting in the common air, the diminution is remarkably less than in other water. In general the diminution was nearly as great with rain as with distilled water; but sometimes the former would froth a good deal: in which case it was no better than water fouled with oak-shavings. This difference of diminution, according to the nature of the water, is a very great inconvenience, and seems to be the chief cause of uncertainty in trying the purity of the air; but it is by no means peculiar to this method, being equally great in that of Fontana's. In his method indeed it makes little difference whether the water be deprived to froth or not; but this is no great advantage, as it is easy to find water which will not froth; though it shows plainly how little any of the experiments hitherto made on the purity of air can be depended upon.\" The best method of obviating this inconvenience is to be always careful to use the same kind of water; our author always made use of distilled water; but found that even this was sometimes endowed with a greater power of absorbing nitrous air than at others: and with a view to remedy this, he made the following experiment. Some distilled water being purged of its air by boiling, one part was kept for a week in a bottle with phlogisticated air, and frequently shaken; the other part being treated in the same manner with phlogisticated air. By a mean of three different trials the test of common air tried with the first of these waters was 1.139; the diminution suffered by shaking nitrous air in it for two seconds being about 0.285. The test of the same air tried with the other water was 1.054, and the diminution by nitrous air only 0.09; the heat of the water in the tub and of the distilled waters being 45\u00b0. The heat of the water in the tub and the distilled waters was then raised to 67\u00b0; when the test of the same air tried by the first water was 1.100, and by the latter 1.044; the diminution of nitrous air with the first water being 0.235; by the latter 0.089. Hence it might seem that the observed test ought to be corrected by the subtraction of 1/36ths of the diminution which nitrous air suffers by being shaken in the water, and adding 0.02 for every three degrees of heat above 0;\n\nbut though this correction will undoubtedly diminish the error, he is of opinion that it will not by any means take it away entirely; and from some circumstances it appears that distilled water possesses a property of absorbing different quantities of nitrous air independent of its heat. In the second method, viz. when the nitrous acid is added to the common air, the diminution is considerably less than in the other; the reason of which is, that when nitrous and common air are mixed together, the former is deprived of part of its phlogiston, and thereby converted into phlogisticated nitrous acid, and in that state is absorbed by the water; besides that the common air is phlogisticated, and thereby diminished; so that the whole diminution on mixing is equal to the bulk of nitrous air which is turned into acid, added to the diminution which the common air suffers by being phlogisticated. Now it appears, that when a small quantity of nitrous air comes in contact with a large one of common air, the former is more completely deprived of its phlogiston, and absorbed by the water in a more phlogisticated state than when a small quantity of common air comes into contact with a large quantity of nitrous; in the second method, therefore, where small portions of nitrous air come in contact with a large quantity of common air, the former, as has been just observed, is more deprived of its phlogiston; and therefore a smaller quantity of it is required to phlogisticate the common air than in the former method, where small portions of common air come in contact with a large quantity of nitrous air; so that a less quantity of the nitrous air is absorbed in the second method than in the first. The common air most probably suffers an equal diminution in both cases. Another proof that a smaller quantity of nitrous air is required in this method than the former is, that if common air be mixed with a quantity of nitrous air not sufficient to phlogisticate it, the mixture will be more phlogisticated if the nitrous be added slowly to the common air without being in contact with water; the mixture will be found to be still more phlogisticated than in the second method where the two airs are in contact with water at the time of mixing. The final result of Mr Cavendish's experiments on this subject is, Conclusions that nitrous air used in the first method does not phlogisticate common air more than three-fourths of the same quantity used in the second way; and not so much, as one half of the quantity used in the third way, viz. by adding the nitrous air slowly to the other, without being in contact with water.",

      "text": "As naturalists became more accustomed to exact observation in every topic of inquiry, the condensation which obtains in the mixture of different substances became more familiarly known. This evidently affects the present question; and both the excise and the distillers are interested in its accurate decision. This occasioned an application to the Royal Society; and a most scrupulous examination of the strength of spirituous liquors was made by Sir Charles Blagden and Mr Gilpin, of which they have given a very particular account in the Philosophical Transactions for 1790 and 1792. We have taken notice of this in the article SPECIFIC GRAVITY. SPI\n\nGRAVITY, mentioning such circumstances of the results as suited our purposes of physical discussion. At present we give the general result in the table of specific gravity, as peculiarly belonging to spirituous liquors, affording the most exact account of their density in every state of dilution of alcohol with water. And as the relation between the proportion of ingredients and the density is peculiar to every substance, so that scarcely any inference can be made from one to another, the reader will consider the tables here given as characteristic with respect to alcohol. In all solutions of salts we found that the condensation increases continually with the dilution, whereas it is greatest when equal bulks of water and alcohol are mixed; yet we do not consider this as an exception; for it is certain, that in the strongest brine the saline ingredient bears but a small proportion to the water\u2014and when we mix two solutions, the condensation is greatest when they are nearly equal in bulk. But we think ourselves entitled to infer, that alcohol is not a dilution of a substance in a quantity of water; but that water, in a certain proportion, not very distant from what we can produce by slow distillation, is an ingredient of alcohol, or is one of its component parts, and not merely a vehicle or menstruum. We therefore imagine that proof spirit contains nearly equal bulks of water and ardent spirits. The great difficulty in this examination arose from the very dissimilar expansions of water and alcohol by heat. This determined Sir Charles Blagden to estimate the proportions of ingredients by weight, and make it absolutely necessary to give a scale of specific gravity and strength for every temperature. For it must be remarked, that the question (whether in commerce or philosophy) always is, \"How many gallons of alcohol and of water, taken just now and mixed together, will produce a hundred gallons of the spirit we are examining?\" The proportion of these two will be different according to the temperature of both. As many mixtures therefore must have been made in each proportion as there were temperatures considered; but by taking the ingredients by weight, and examining the density of the compound in one temperature, it is then heated and cooled, and its change of density observed. Calculation then can tell us the change in the proportion of the bulks or numbers of gallons in the mixture, by means of a previous table showing the expansions of water and of alcohol. The alcohol selected for this examination had the specific gravity 0.825. This is not the purest that can be procured; some was produced of 0.816, of 0.814, and 0.813, both obtained from rum, from brandy, and from malt spirit. We are informed that Dr Black has obtained it of the specific gravity 0.8 by digesting alcohol with fixed ammonia (muriatic acid united with lime) made very dry. It dephlegmates alcohol very powerfully without decomposing it, which always happens when we use caustic alkali. Alcohol of 0.825 was chosen because expressed by a number of easy management in computation. The examination commenced by ascertaining the expansions of water and alcohol. The temperature 60\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's scale was selected for the general temperature of comparison, being easily attainable even in cold weather, and allowing the examinator to operate at ease. The first and last copartments of the tables contain the weights and specific gravities of alcohol and water for every fifth degree of heat from 30\u00b0 to 100\u00b0. From these we have constructed the two following little tables of expansion. The bulk of 1000 ounces, pounds, or other weight of water and of alcohol of the temperature 60\u00b0, occupies the bulks expressed in the tables for every other temperature. Water could not be easily or usefully examined when of the temperature 30\u00b0, because it is with great difficulty kept fluid in that temperature. It is very remarkable, that when it can be kept, it expands instead of contracting; while cooling down from 35\u00b0 or thereabouts, and as it approaches to 32\u00b0, it expands rapidly. We observe the same thing in the crystallization of Glauber salt, martial vitriol, and some others, which contain much water in their crystals. We observe, on the other hand, a remarkable contraction in the zeolite just before its beginning to swell into bubbles by a red heat. | Heat | Of Water | Diff.",

      "text": "II. Of the Bones of the Head. The head is of a roundish figure, and somewhat oval (F). Its greatest diameter is from the forehead to the occiput; its upper part is called vertex, or crown of the head; its anterior or fore-part the face; and the upper part of this, sinciput, or forehead; its sides the temples; its posterior, or hind part, the occiput; Osteology and its inferior part the basis. The bones of the head may be divided into those of the cranium and face. \u00a7 I. Bones of the Cranium and Face. There are eight bones of the cranium, viz. the coronal bone or os frontis; the two parietal bones or ossa bregmati; the os occipitis; the two temporal bones; the sphenoid bone; and the os ethmoides or cribriforme. Of these, only the os occipitis and ossa bregmati are considered as proper to the cranium; the rest being common both to the cranium and face. These bones are all harder at their surface than in their middle; and on this account they are divided into two tables, and a middle spongy substance called dipl\u00f6e. In this, as in all the other bones, we shall consider its figure, structure, processes, depressions, and cavities; frontis, and the manner in which it is articulated with the other bones. The os frontis has some resemblance in shape to the shell of the cockle. Externally it is convex, its concave side being turned towards the brain. This bone, in the places where it is united to the temporal bones, is very thin, and has there no dipl\u00f6e. It is likewise exceedingly thin in that part of the orbit of the eye which is nearest to the nose. Hence it is, that a wound in the eye, by a sword, or any other pointed instrument, is sometimes productive of immediate death. In these cases, the sword passing through the weak part of the bone, penetrates the brain, and divides the nerves at their origin; or perhaps opens some blood-vessel, the consequences of which are soon fatal. We observe on the exterior surface of this bone five apophyses or processes, which are easily to be distinguished. One of these is placed at the bottom and narrowest part of the bone, and is called the nasal process, from its supporting the upper end of the bones of the nose. The four others are called angular or orbital processes. They assist to form the orbits, which are the cavities on which the eyes are placed. In each of these orbits there are two processes, one at the interior or great angle, and the other at the exterior or little angle of the orbit. They are called the angular processes. Between these a ridge is extended in form of an arch, and on this the eyebrows are placed. It is called the orbital or superciliary ridge, and in some measure covers and defends the globe of the eye. There is a hole in this for the passage of the frontal vessels and nerves. This arch is interrupted near the nose by a small pit, in which the tendon of the musculus obliquus major of the eye is fixed. From the under part of each superciliary ridge a thin plate runs a considerable way backwards, and has the name of orbital; the external and fore part of this plate forms\n\n(F) The bones of the foetus being perfectly distinct, and the muscles in young persons not acting much, the shape of the head has been supposed to depend much on the management of children when very young. Vesalius, who has remarked the difference in people of different nations, observes, for instance, that the head of a Turk is conical, from the early use of the turban; whilst that of an Englishman is flattened by the chin-stay. Some of the latest physiologists suppose, with good reason, that this difference is chiefly owing to certain natural causes with which we are as yet unacquainted.",

It will be necessary to distinguish its body and extremities: Its body, which is of a cylindrical shape, is convex before and concave behind, where it serves to lodge several muscles. Throughout two-thirds of its length we observe a ridge, called linea aspera, which originates from the trochanters, and after running for some way downwards, divides into two branches, that terminate in the tuberosities at the lower extremity of the bone. At its upper extremity we must describe the neck and smooth head of the bone, and likewise two considerable processes: The head, which forms the greater portion of a sphere unequally divided, is turned forwards, and received into the great cotyloid cavity of the os innominatum. At this part of the bone there is a little fossa to be observed, to which the round ligament is attached, and which we have already described as tending to secure the head of this bone in the great acetabulum. The neck is almost horizontal, considered with respect to its situation with the body of the bone. Of the two processes, the external one, which is the largest, is called trochanter major; and the other, which is placed on the inside of the bone, trochanter minor. They both afford attachment to muscles. The articulation of the os femoris with the trunk is strengthened by means of a capsular ligament, which adheres everywhere round the edge of the great cotyloid cavity of the os innominatum, and surrounds the head of the bone. The os femoris moves upon the trunk in every direction. At the lower extremity of the bone are two processes called the condyles, and an intermediate smooth cavity, by means of which it is articulated with the leg by gin-glimus. All round the under end of the bone there is an irregular surface where the capsular ligament of the joint has its origin, and where blood-vessels go into the substance of the bone. Between the condyles there is a cavity posteriorly, in which the blood-vessels and nerves are placed, secure from the compression to which they would otherwise be exposed in the action of bending the leg, and which would not fail to be hurtful. At the side of each condyle externally, there is a tuberosity, from whence the lateral ligaments originate, which are extended down to the tibia. A ligament likewise arises from each condyle posteriorly. One of these ligaments passes from the right to the left, and the other from the left to the right, so that they intersect each other, and for that reason are called the cross ligaments. The lateral ligaments prevent the motion of the leg upon the thigh to the right or left, and the cross ligaments, which are also attached to the tibia, prevent the latter from being brought forwards. In new born children all the processes of this bone are cartilaginous.",

The principal of these are the blowing up of rocks, the separating of stones in quarries, and other purposes of that kind. The destruction occasioned by them in times of war, and the machines formed upon the principle of explosion for the destruction of the human race, are well known; and if we cannot call these useless, we must allow them at least to be necessary evils. For the production of explosions, gunpowder is the only substance that has yet been found to answer; nevertheless, as its use is attended with considerable expense, several attempts have been made to find out a cheap substitute for it. One of the most remarkable of these was by mixing small quantities of water, enclosed in little bladders or some easily destructible vehicles, along with a charge of powder. By this contrivance it was hoped that the water being converted into vapour when the powder was inflamed, would augment the force of the explosion; but instead of this, it was found greatly to diminish it. The reason was evident, viz. that the conversion of the water into steam required much of the latent heat of the inflamed gunpowder, that enough was not left to give the necessary expansion to the aerial fluid produced. A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases has also been tried; but the explosion here has always been found too weak. In mines, indeed, very terrible effects are produced by such a mixture, but in these the quantity is immense; so that the comparative weakness of the mixture cannot be discovered. Electricity therefore seems to be the only resource we have; except by adding ingredients to gunpowder which may increase the strength of it. There can be no doubt indeed that the electric fluid is possessed of sufficient strength to perform every thing we could desire; and electricians have supposed, perhaps justly enough, that a cannon charged with water might, by means of electricity, become more dangerous than one charged with gunpowder; but this fluid is so exceedingly capricious, so imperceptible and unmanageable, that the use of it cannot as yet be thought practicable, nor in all probability ever will be so.\n\n",

But, if that should not happen, yet he will act, as very wise and very great men have acted, in paying a respectful deference to the avowed conviction of others. The most intelligent and powerful men of ancient Rome, not only appeared to believe a very absurd and hurtful system, but assisted in all its ceremonies as priests. Even Socrates, who evidently entertained some notions adequate to the dignity of the one great and supreme Being, yet thought it was a duty which he owed to his country, so far to conform to the wretched establishment, as to order in his dying words a sacrifice to \u00c6sculapius. This external conformity to the national religion ought not to be confounded with hypocrisy. If indeed it is carried to extremes, or zealously affected, it certainly is very blameable and contemptible deceit; but while it keeps within the bounds of reason and moderation, it ought to be called a decent deference to the opinions of the majority, arising from humility, and from a desire to maintain the tranquillity of the state, and to continue an innocent and useful system, which has, and will always greatly contribute to lessen the quantity and degree both of moral and of natural evil.\n\n\"",

And this pix is, from time to time, by the king's command, opened at Westminster, in the presence of the lord-chancellor, the lords of the council, the lords commissioners of the treasury, the justices of the several benches, and the barons of the exchequer; before whom a trial is made, by a jury of goldsmiths impannelled and sworn for that purpose, of the collective weights of certain parcels of the several pieces of gold and silver taken at random from those contained in the pix; after which those parcels being severally melted, assays are then made of the bullion.\nbullion of gold and silver so produced, by the melting certain small quantities of the same against equal weights taken from the respective trial pieces of gold and silver that are deposited and kept in the exchequer for that use. This is called the trial of the pix; the report made by the jury upon that trial is called the verdict of the pix for that time; and the indented trial pieces just above mentioned, are certain plates of standard gold and standard silver, made with the greatest care, and delivered in upon oath, from time to time as there is occasion, by a jury of the most able and experienced goldsmiths, summoned by virtue of a warrant from the lords of the treasury to the wardens of the mystery of goldsmiths of the city of London for that purpose; and which plates being so delivered in, are divided each, at this time, into seven parts by indentures, one of which parts is kept in his majesty's court of exchequer at Westminster, another by the said company of goldsmiths, and two more by the officers of his majesty's mint in the Tower; the remaining three being for the use of the mint, &c., in Scotland.

These marks are first observable upon the coins of King Edward III.; the words above quoted concerning those marks are from the indentures made with the lord Hastings, master and worker to King Edward IV.; and the marks themselves continued to be stamped very conspicuously upon the moneys, till the coinage by the mill and screw was introduced and settled after the Restoration, in the year 1662; since which time, the moneys being made with far greater regularity and exactness than before, these marks have either been totally laid aside, or such only have been used as are of a more secret nature, and only known to the officers and engravers concerned in the coinage: and indeed the constant practice that has ever since prevailed, of dating all the several pieces, has rendered all such marks of much less consequence than before.\n\nMINT.

An ear, a voice, skill in instrumental music, and, above all, a poetical genius, are requisite to excel in that complicated art. As such talents are rare, the few that possessed them were highly esteemed; and hence the profession of a bard, which, besides natural talents, required more culture and exercise than any other known art. Bards were capital persons at every festival and at every solemnity. Their songs, which, by recording the achievements of kings and heroes, animated every hearer, must have been the entertainment of every warlike nation. We have Hesiod's authority, that in his time bards were as common as potters or joiners, and as liable to envy. Demodocus is mentioned by Homer as a celebrated bard; and Phemius, another bard, is introduced by him deprecating the wrath of Ulysses in the following words:\n\n\"O King! to mercy be thy soul inclin'd,\n\"And spare the poet's ever-gentle kind:\n\"A deed like this thy future fame would wrong,\n\"For dear to gods and men is sacred song.\n\"Self-taught I sing; by heav'n, and heav'n alone,\n\"The genuine seeds of poetry are sown;\n\"And (what the gods bestow) the lofty lay,\n\"To gods alone, and godlike worth, we pay.\"\n\n\"Cicero reports, that at Roman festivals, anciently, the virtus and exploits of their great men were sung.

He had now reached the 80th year of a life which had been entirely spent in a laborious and incessant application to study, which had secretly weakened the springs of existence. The rigour of the winter of 1795, against which he had adopted no precautions, is supposed to have hastened the catastrophe; this did not occur, however, until the spring. On the 25th of April he dined with Madame de Choiseul. In the course of the night he became so weak that he was unable to ring his bell; and in the morning, when his servant entered, he was found with his feet in the bed and his head on the floor, entirely deprived of sensation. After being replaced, his recollection returned, but he grew gradually worse, and he was carried off without experiencing any pain, April 30, 1795. He retained full possession of all his senses until the very last moment. At one o'clock he read Horace as if nothing extraordinary had occurred; but his hands turning cold, in consequence of the approach of death, became unable to support the book, which fell to the ground. His head soon after was seen to incline on one side, he appeared to sleep, and it was believed by his nephew and his attendants that this was really the case; but it was soon discovered that his respiration had ceased, and that this learned man was no more! Thus died, without any of the usual struggles that accompany death, John James Barthelemy, one of the greatest ornaments of his age, regretted by all his relations as if he had been their common father, whose life presented an example, and whose works form a model for literary men. In person he was above the middle size, and, if we are to give credit to his admirers, his countenance displayed an air of antiquity wonderfully correspondent to his studies. His bust, carved by the chisel of Houdon, is allowed to be a masterpiece of art, and that able sculptor has contrived to infuse into the physiognomy a mixture of the mildness, simplicity, good-nature, and grandeur, so visible in the original.",

Muschenbroek supposed that heat is ponderous, or produced by a ponderous substance; and Buffon thought he had proved, by his own experiments, that a body is heavier when it is hot than when it is cold; but when similar experiments were repeated, particularly by Dr Roebuck and Mr Whitehurst, with very nice and delicate balances, the bodies which were weighed appeared heavier cold than when they were hot. This seems to be owing to the rarefaction of the air surrounding that scale in which the heated body is placed; the buoyancy of which favours an ascending motion in the scale. From more recent experiments, and particularly one made by Dr Fordyce, it appeared that bodies become heavier, but in a very small degree only, not by the increase, but by the diminution of temperature. When the whole quantity of 1700 grs. of water was frozen, it was found to be, when carefully weighed, 3/6ths of a grain heavier than it had been when fluid. At this time the thermometer applied to the vessel which contained the frozen water, stood at 10\u00b0; but when it was allowed to remain till the thermometer rose to 32\u00b0, it weighed only 3/6ths of a grain more than when fluid, and at the same temperature. That the addition of caloric to bodies produces no sensible change on their weight, seems to be placed beyond a doubt by the accurate experiments of Lavoisier, which were made with a view of ascertaining whether the weight of bodies is altered by heating or cooling them; but he found no difference. In the year 1787, Count Rumford repeated the experiment of Dr Fordyce with the greatest care; and varying it in every possible way to avoid error, the results led him to conclude, that there is no sensible difference in the weight of bodies, either by the addition or abstraction of caloric. 3. Caloric agrees with light in another of its peculiar properties; this is, its repulsive power, or the tendency of its particles to separate from each other. The particles of caloric, therefore, can never be supposed to cohere.",

Roe of Mackerel. (9.) With Epsom salt two drams, and water two ounces. On the second night, the liquid, when agitated, was exceedingly bright; on the third, the same; and on the fourth and fifth, still lucid. Dr Holme found that some substances have the power of extinguishing this light. It was quickly extinguished when mixed with water alone, with water impregnated with lime, carbonic acid gas, or sulphurated hydrogen gas; by fermented liquors and ardent spirits; by the acids, both concentrated and diluted; by the alkalies when dissolved in water; by many of the neutral salts, as the solutions of common salt, Epsom salt, and sal ammoniac. It was also extinguished by infusions of chamomile flowers, of long pepper, and of camphor, made with boiling hot water, but not used till quite cool. When the substances emitting this light were placed in a freezing medium, the light was in a short time quite extinguished; but when exposed to a moderate degree of temperature, it was revived. A moderate degree of heat increased this light, but it was extinguished by a high temperature, and no luminous appearance could again be discovered. 4. When all the rays of light are reflected from any body, that body is said to be white; when all the rays are absorbed, the body which absorbs them is said to be black; but experience informs us, that different bodies absorb and reflect different rays. Thus, if a body absorb all the rays excepting the yellow, that body is said to be of a yellow colour; or if a body reflect the red rays, while the others are absorbed, it is said to be red. The colour of the body is characterized by the colour of the ray which is reflected. 5. One of the most singular effects which is observed in the combination of light with bodies, is its power of reducing the oxides of the metals. Some of these, as for instance, the red oxide of lead, when exposed to the light of the sun, lose part of their weight. The oxide of gold may be reduced in the same way, the white salts of silver become black, and the oxide is reduced; and when that process is going on, oxygen gas is emitted, which, it would appear, has been separated by the action of light. Some of the rays are found to have a greater effect than others. Scheele, who made a set of experiments to ascertain the difference of effect of the different coloured rays in blackening the muriate of silver, discovered that the violet ray was the most powerful in reducing the oxide of silver. It was formerly the general opinion, that the colorific rays of light were the cause of the reduction of the oxides of the metals; but the experiments and observations of Messrs Bockman and Ritter in Germany, and of Dr Wollaston in England, prove that the muriate of silver is more strongly and rapidly darkened by rays of the sun which have been more refracted than the violet rays: for it appeared that the muriate was affected in a space lying beyond the violet light. These rays, therefore, have not the property of giving light, nor do they produce any sensible degree of heat: in fact, it appears that there are three different sets of rays; namely, rays which illuminate, rays which warm without giving any light (which will be mentioned in the next chapter), and rays which produce a chemical action on bodies, but which give neither light or heat. From the consideration of these curious and interesting experiments, it has been very naturally supposed, that the chemical actions dependent on solar light are owing to the invisible rays which are refracted beyond the violet rays; and that the colorific rays have no share in these actions: for it has been observed, that the effect of the different colours increases with their refrangibility; the whole therefore is owing to the invisible rays, which increase in quantity as they approach to the violet ray, and are in greatest quantity at a certain distance beyond it. 6.",

One change has been observed during this process; namely, that the quantity of sugar is always diminishing, and, at the end of the process, is entirely decomposed. The liquid is now more fluid, is specifically lighter, and has obtained a vinous taste; which new properties are ascribed to the formation of alcohol which exists in all wine. It would appear, from the experiments of M. Lavoisier, that it is the sugar only which has suffered decomposition. It is divided into two portions, one of which separates, and is carried off in the form of carbonic acid gas, while the other, containing a greater proportion of hydrogen, remains in the liquid, in the form of alcohol. Part of the alcohol is carried off, and the alcohol which remains in the liquid is combined with the acids of the wine and the colouring matter, from which it must be separated by distillation. The tartaric acid, it has also been found, is partially decomposed during the process, and a portion of malic acid is formed. It appears from other experiments, that azotic gas is disengaged during this process, from which it is inferred, that some others of the constituents of the fermenting liquid have been decomposed, since sugar contains no azote. 5.",

      "text": "In this case they seem to move very slowly, and often be absolutely stationary for some time. The reason of this most probably is, that they are impelled by two opposite streams of air nearly of equal strength; by which means their velocity is greatly retarded. In such cases both the aerial currents seem to ascend to a very considerable height; for Messrs. Charles and Roberts, when endeavouring to avoid a thunder-cloud in one of their aerial voyages, could\ncould find no alteration in the course of the current, though they ascended to the height of 4000 feet from the surface of the earth. In some cases the motions of the clouds evidently depend on their electricity, independent of any current of air whatever. Thus, in a calm and warm day, we often see small clouds meeting each other in opposite directions, and setting out from such short distances, that we cannot suppose any opposite winds to be the cause. These clouds, when they meet, instead of forming a larger one, become much less, and sometimes vanish altogether; a circumstance undoubtedly owing to the discharge of opposite electricities into each other. This serves also to throw some light on the true cause of the formation of clouds; for if two clouds electrified, the one positively and the other negatively, destroy each other in contact; it follows, that any quantity of vapour suspended in the atmosphere, while it retains its natural quantity of electricity, remains invisible, but becomes a cloud when electrified either plus or minus. A difficulty, however, still occurs; viz. in what manner a small quantity of vapour surrounded by an immense ocean of the same kind of matter, can acquire either more or less electricity than that which surrounds it; and this indeed we seem not as yet to have any data to solve in a satisfactory manner. The shapes of the clouds are likewise undoubtedly owing to their electricity; for in those seasons in which a great commotion has been excited in the atmospheric electricity, we shall perceive the clouds assuming strange and whimsical shapes, which vary almost every moment. This, as well as the meeting of small clouds in the air, and vanishing upon contact, is an almost infallible sign of thunder. Besides the phenomena of thunder, rain, &c. the clouds are intimately connected with those of wind, and always assume a particular shape, when a strong continued wind is about to ensue; though it is remarkable, that in the strongest winds we shall often observe them stationary. Sometimes also, on the approach of a cloud, we shall find a sudden and violent gust of wind arise; and at others, the wind, though violent before, shall cease on the approach of a cloud, and recover its strength as soon as the cloud is past. This connection of the clouds with wind is most remarkable in mountainous countries, when the peaks are sufficiently high to have their tops involved in clouds. A very remarkable mountain of this kind is met with at the Cape of Good Hope, from the clouds on whose top, according to the relations of travellers, the winds issue forth as if they had been confined in a bag; and something similar has been observed of mountains in other parts of the world. The uses of the clouds are evident; as from them proceeds the rain which refreshes the earth; and without which, according to the present system of nature, the whole surface of the earth must be a mere desert. They are likewise of great use as a screen interposed between the earth and the scorching rays of the sun, which are often so powerful as to destroy the grass and other tender vegetables. In the more secret operations of nature also, where the electrical fluid is concerned, the clouds bear a principal share; and serve especially as a medium for conveying that fluid from the atmosphere into the earth, and from the earth into the atmosphere; in doing which, when electrified to a great degree, they sometimes produce very terrible effects.

It may be seen from this figure that the web of the shoe is hollow; that the heels at aa are narrower than the other parts of the shoe, and that the nails are placed all round from the toe backwards. Fig. 20. shows that the heels of the shoe are much thinner than the point, and also shows the manner in which the nails are riveted or clinched on the outside of the hoof round the toe and crust. The only remaining method of shoeing that we shall Mr Morecroft's method here mention, is that of the ingenious Mr Morecroft. This gentleman has acquired much celebrity by his invention of casting shoes, by sinking them in dies, by which means horses may be fitted with any shoes best adapted to their hoofs. Mr Morecroft's shoe differs from Osmer's, in being concave within for more than half its width. He condemns the use of calkins, on the principle that the public roads are now much more solid than when calkins were in general use; and consequently, that instead of sinking them into the ground, they rather tend to raise the heels above it, and thus the frog is prevented from receiving the necessary pressure. Mr Morecroft, however, allows calkins to heavy draught-horses, for whom he recommends two on each shoe; but in lighter horses of the same description, one on the outside of each shoe. The latter is also recommended for hunters, but for other riding horses he forbids the use of calkins. The number of nails in Mr Morecroft's shoe is usually eight, but in heavy draught horses they are not to be placed on the sides of the shoe, but all round at equal distance, leaving a space at the heels of about two inches or two inches and a half. In frosty weather, Mr Morecroft recommends nails with a lozenge head, or a double countersink, terminating in an edge instead of coming to a point, which greater breadth of surface prevents its being rubbed away so fast as a point. The thickness in the middle gives it strength, and the regular taper to the shank causes it to apply exactly to the side of the hole in the shoe, by which it is equally supported, and prevented from bending or breaking. Mr Coleman considering pressure as necessary to the healthy action of the frog, has contrived a method of artificial affording this pressure in those cases in which, from diseased feet, or bad management in shoeing, it cannot naturally receive it; and where, if the heels were lowered, in order to bring the frog in contact with the ground, there would be danger of straining the tendons. Mr Coleman's patent artificial frogs are intended to produce\nduce pressure on the natural frogs, while the horses are standing in the stable, and thus to give time for the growth of the heels, and to avoid the evils that would arise from lowering these too suddenly, or from allowing the frog to remain elevated above the ground. For the particulars of this ingenious invention, we must refer to Mr Coleman's pamphlet. Where oxen are worked in farming business like horses, it is generally thought necessary to defend their hoofs in a similar manner by means of iron shoes. The form and manner of fitting these do not appear to be universally the same in all places; nor are we acquainted with the methods usually practised. We know that M. St Bel recommended the following methods; either to shoe the ox with a flat plate of iron, having six or seven nail holes on the outer edge, accompanied with a projection of four or five inches of iron at the toe, which passing the cleft of the foot, is bent over the hoof: or with eight shoes, one under each nail; otherwise with four, one under each internal nail; or only two, one under the external nail of each fore-foot. **Chap.",

His father having taught him the principles of grammar, he afterwards attended lectures in the Mazarine college, where he delivered his rhetorical exercises in 1706. A total eclipse of the sun having taken place on the 12th of March that year, his taste for mathematics was thus discovered, and he was accordingly placed under a proper tutor, who taught him the elements of geometry, fortification and mechanics; but his favourite study was the science of astronomy.\n\nIn 1707 he was offered the place of an engineer at Martinico, which made him acquainted with the art of drawing, an acquisition which proved highly useful to him in his geographical labours, and also in the study of astronomy. His father having got a copy of An Account of a Voyage to the South sea from his son's master, young de Lisle was excited by the perusal of it to the study of natural history, and he began to make collections of insects, and sketch their varieties; but being afterwards persuaded that so extensive a study, requiring such immense collections to be made as he found in Aldrovandus, was wholly incompatible with that unremitting attention which his favourite science required, he relinquished it accordingly. The attention he paid to astronomical researches was so great, that he was considered as meriting the correspondence of some of the ablest astronomers of Europe at the early age of 21. In 1729 he made a wooden quadrant, which he divided with the utmost accuracy, and which answered the intended purpose in his early observations. He likewise constructed a table for M. Cassini, of the right ascensions and declinations, adapted to all the degrees of latitude and longitude of the planets, and the obliquity of the ecliptic; this table was made use of by M. Cassini in foretelling the occultations of the stars by the moon.\n\nDe Lisle being informed by Cassini in 1710 of his method of representing an eclipse of the sun, by the projection of a terrestrial parallel on a plane; he instantly conceived the idea of applying it to every part of the earth, by means of a globe mounted and prepared for that purpose. Such astronomers as he made acquainted with his project, conceived it to be impracticable; but when the machine was completed, they bestowed the highest encomiums on the noble invention. The first memorable observation made by de Lisle was\nthat of the moon, on the 23rd of January 1712, after which his labours experienced some interruption from bodily indisposition. About this time the situation of his father's numerous family rendered it necessary that he should provide for himself, so that he was obliged to make his astronomical knowledge subservient to the absurdities of astrology, receiving pecuniary presents from the regent for his services. He received also in 1715 the grant of a pension of 600 livres, on which occasion he calculated tables of the moon according to the Newtonian theory, prior to Halley's communications to him, which were printed in 1719. De Lisle was chosen a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1714, on which account his exertions were redoubled.\n\n",

An action was brought in 1788, in the court of exchequer at Edinburgh, to determine whether several disputed cases fell under the meaning of the act, and were liable to duty, when the following decisions were given:\n\nSaddle-horses both hired and paid by the mile, and saddle-horses hired originally for an excursion, but afterwards paid by the mile, were found liable to duty according to the number of miles paid for; carriage-horses, where the carriage is hired and paid for only at the usual rate of outgoing carriages, and no more, whether the person hiring it does or does not return in it, were found liable to duty only for the number of miles out; but if the carriage be hired and paid for, or actually paid for, though not originally hired, at the usual rate of carriages employed both to carry out and bring back the same company, the duty was found to be exigible according to the number of miles both out and home taken together. Hackney-coaches in Edinburgh, hired and paid for less than two miles, were found liable to duty for one mile.\n\nNo duty was found to be exigible on saddle-horses hired\nhired for a mere excursion, and paid for accordingly, where the distance neither is nor can be ascertained; on hackney-coaches employed in the streets for less than a mile, or for an excursion or round of visits merely; and on horses or carriages hired for a journey of three days or more, and paid for accordingly, or paid for at the rate of three days, though the journey should actually be performed in two full travelling days. The general rule of these decisions was, that in every case, except unascertainable distance, or journeys exceeding two days, the mode of travelling fell under the legal definition of posting. The only point that may seem doubtful in the judgments here stated, is that where the duty is found chargeable by the number of miles both going and returning. Yet as the law expressly declares, that horses hired by the mile or stage are to be deemed posting, and as the number of miles for which they are hired can only be ascertained by the number paid for, it is clear, that where an addition to the outgoing charge is made on account of bringing back the person hiring the carriage, the carriage in that case is actually hired and paid for according to the number of miles both out and home, and the duty must fall to be rated accordingly. The doubtful points being now settled by the above decisions, the mode of levying the duty in Scotland has been regulated agreeably to them ever since the matter was thus determined.",

By way of experiment, he planted sets from roots which had been infected the year before, and some of these produced healthy plants, free from all infection. As every effect must have a cause, he supposed it might be some insect, which, living on the leaves, gave them that curled and sickly appearance, as in the case in the leaves of many shrubs and trees. But whether the insect is lodged in the old sets, and to be destroyed at the time of planting, or proceeding from some external cause, can only be destroyed afterwards, he is not yet certain, although he has made the following experiments. On a piece of ground that had not been dug for 20 years, he planted four rows of sets, which he knew to be perfectly clear; the drills were two feet distant, the distance of sets one foot distant in each drill. He then planted on the same ground four rows with sets from curled potatoes, at equal distances; in each row were about 20 sets. Lot 1st, The curled sets. No.",

Selfishness, caprice, indolence, effeminacy, all join to loosen the bonds of society, to bring on the degeneracy both of the useful and the fine arts, to banish at once the mild and the austere virtues, to destroy civil order and subordination, and to introduce in their room anarchy or despotism.\n\nScarcely could we have found an example of the beautiful form of society which we last attempted to describe. Never, at least, has any nation continued long to enjoy such happy circumstances, or to display so amiable and respectable a character. But when we speak of the declining state of society, we have no difficulty in finding instances to which we may refer. History tells of the Assyrians, the Egyptians, and the Persians, all of them once flourishing nations, but brought low by luxury and an unhappy corruption of manners. The Greeks, the Romans, and the Assyrians, owed their fall to the same causes; and we know not if a similar fate does not now threaten many of those nations who have long made a distinguished figure in the system of Europe. The Portuguese, the Venetians, and the Spaniards, have already fallen; and what is the present state of our neighbours the French? They have long been a people destitute of religion, corrupted in morals, unsteady in conduct, and slaves to pleasure and public amusements. Among them luxury had arrived at its highest pitch; and the consequence has been, that after capriciously shaking off the yoke of despotism, they have established, or rather set up (for established it cannot be), a motley kind of government, which, in the course of a few years, has exhibited scenes of tyranny and oppression, to which we doubt if the annals of the world can furnish any parallel.

The proportion of water and the strongest spirits or alcohol, according to the views and language of excisemen. The advantages of these beads are, that being made of a substance which is little acted on by chemical agents, they are less liable to be injured by use, than instruments composed of metal; and when a bead happens to be broken, it can be easily replaced. They possess this farther advantage, that with the application of the thermometer, and the calculation of the sliding rule, the real strength of the spirits may be taken at all temperatures. It has been suggested, that these beads, from their being less liable to change than other instruments, might be usefully employed in checking the errors and variations of other hydrometers. Beads are repaired by Mrs Lovi on the same principle for ascertaining the strength of worts, acids, &c. spirits sent we give the general result in the table of specific gravity, as peculiarly belonging to spirituous liquors, affording the most exact account of their density in every state of dilution of alcohol with water. And as the relation between the proportion of ingredients and the density is peculiar to every substance, so that scarcely any inference can be made from one to another, the reader will consider the tables here given as characteristic with respect to alcohol. In all solutions of salts we found that the condensation increases continually with the dilution, whereas it is greatest when equal bulks of water and alcohol are mixed; yet we do not consider this as an exception; for it is certain, that in the strongest brine the saline ingredient bears but a small proportion to the water\u2014and when we mix two solutions, the condensation is greatest when they are nearly equal in bulk. But we think ourselves entitled to infer, that alcohol is not a dilution of a substance in a quantity of water; but that water, in a certain proportion, not very distant from what we can produce by slow distillation, is an ingredient of alcohol, or is one of its component parts, and not merely a vehicle or menstruum. We therefore imagine that proof spirit contains nearly equal bulks of water and ardent spirits. The great difficulty in this examination arose from the very dissimilar expansions of water and alcohol by heat. This determined Sir Charles Blagden to estimate the proportions of ingredients by weight, and made it absolutely necessary to give a scale of specific gravity and strength for every temperature. For it must be remarked, that the question (whether in commerce or philosophy) always is, \"How many gallons of alcohol and of water, taken just now and mixed together, will produce a hundred gallons of the spirit we are examining?\" The proportion of these two will be different according to the temperature of both. As many mixtures therefore must have been made in each proportion as there were temperatures considered; but by taking the ingredients by weight, and examining the density of the compound in one temperature, it is then heated and cooled, and its change of density observed. Calculation then can tell us the change in the proportion of the bulks or numbers of gallons in the mixture, by means of a previous table showing the expansions of water and of alcohol. The alcohol selected for this examination had the specific gravity 0.825. This is not the purest that can be procured; some was produced of 0.816, of 0.814, and 0.813, both obtained from rum, from brandy, and from malt spirit. We are informed that Dr Black has obtained it of the specific gravity 0.8 by digesting alcohol with fixed ammonia (muriatic acid united with lime) made very dry. It dephlogmates alcohol very powerfully without decomposing it, which always happens when we use caustic alkali. Alcohol of 0.825 was chosen because expressed by a number of easy management in computation. The examination commenced by ascertaining the expansions of water and alcohol. The temperature 60\u00b0 of Fahrenheit's scale was selected for the general temperature of comparison, being easily attainable even in cold weather, and allowing the examiner to operate at ease. The first and last compartments of the tables contain the weights and specific gravities of alcohol and water for every fifth degree of heat from 30\u00b0 to 100\u00b0. From these we have constructed the two following little tables of expansion. The bulk of 1000 ounces, pounds, or other weight of water and of alcohol of the temperature 60\u00b0, occupies the bulks expressed in the tables for every other temperature. Water could not be easily or usefully examined when of the temperature 30\u00b0, because it is with great difficulty kept fluid in that temperature. It is very remarkable, that when it can be so kept, it expands instead of contracting; while cooling down from 35\u00b0 or thereabouts, and as it approaches to 32\u00b0, it expands rapidly. We observe the same thing in the crystallization of Glauber salt, muriatic vitriol, and some others, which contain much water in their crystals. We observe, on the other hand, a remarkable contraction in the zeolite just before its beginning to swell into bubbles by a red heat. | Heat | Bulk of 100,000 ounces |\n|------|-----------------------|\n|      | Of Water | Of Alcohol |\n| 30\u00b0  |         |           |\n| 35\u00b0  | 99910   | 119195    |\n| 40\u00b0  | 99906   | 119544    |\n| 45\u00b0  | 99914   | 119839    |\n| 50\u00b0  | 99932   | 120172    |\n| 55\u00b0  | 99962   | 120514    |\n| 60\u00b0  | 100000  | 120868    |\n| 65\u00b0  | 100050  | 121222    |\n| 70\u00b0  | 100106  | 121565    |\n| 75\u00b0  | 100170  | 121919    |\n| 80\u00b0  | 100241  | 122279    |\n| 85\u00b0  | 100320  | 122635    |\n| 90\u00b0  | 100404  | 123017    |\n| 95\u00b0  | 100500  | 123393    |\n| 100\u00b0 | 100608  | 123773    |\n\nThis being premised, the examination was conducted in the following manner. It was determined to mix 100 parts by weight of pure alcohol with five, ten, fifteen, twenty, parts of distilled water, till they were compounded in equal quantities, and then to mix 100 parts of distilled water with, 05, 05, 05, 05, &c., parts of alcohol, till they were mixed in the proportion of 100 to 5. Thus a series of mixtures would be obtained, extending from pure alcohol to pure water. This series would be such, that the examinations would be most frequent in the cases most usual in the commerce of strong liquors. A set of phials, fitted with ground stoppers, were provided, of sizes fit to hold the intended mixtures. These mixtures were made by suspending the phial to the arm of a very nice balance, in the opposite scale of which (besides the counterpoise of the phial) there was placed the weight 100. Spirit was then poured into the phial till it exactly balanced the weight 100. The weight for the water to be added was then put into the opposite scale, and water was poured into the phial by means of a slender glass funnel, by small quantities at a time, and the phial frequently agitated to promote the mixture. When the additional weight was exactly balanced, the phial was taken off, its stopper put in, and leather tied over it, and it was set by, for at least a month, that the mixture and the whole process of condensation might be completed. The same method\nWhen the ingredients of these mixtures were judged to have completely incorporated, their specific gravity was examined by weighing with the most scrupulous precision the contents of a vessel which held 2925 troy grains of water, of the temperature 62\u00b0. The balance was so exceedingly sensible, that the 50th part of a grain greatly deranged its position when loaded with the scales and their contents. It was constructed by Mr Ramsden, and some account of its exquisite sensibility may be seen in the Journal de Physique, vol. xxxiii. This quantity of materials was therefore thought abundantly sufficient for ascertaining the density of the liquor. It is needless to detail the precautions which were taken for having the contents of the weighing bottle brought to the precise temperature proper for the experiment. They were such as every person conversant with such things is accustomed to take.\u2014The bottle had a slender neck, and being put on a lathe, a mark was made round it with a diamond. The bottle was filled till the bottom of the hollow surface of the fluid was in the plane of this mark; and to judge of the accuracy attainable in filling the bottle, the operation was several times repeated and the contents weighed, without the difference of $\\frac{1}{35}$th of a grain in 2925. The only source of error which was to be guarded against was air-bubbles adhering to the inside of the bottle, or moisture condensing (in the experiments with low temperatures) on the outside. Both of these were attended to as much as possible. This method of determining the specific gravity was preferred to the usual method, observing the weight lost by a lump of glass when suspended in water; for Mr Gilpin had been enabled, by means of this nice balance, to discover, even in pure water and in alcohol, a want of perfect fluidity. Something like viscosity rendered the motion of a lump of glass through the liquor sensibly sluggish, so that when the balance was brought to a level, there was not a perfect equilibrium of weight: (See what we have said of this matter in Specific Gravity). Mr Gilpin also tried the ingenious instrument proposed for such experiments by Mr Ramsden, and described by him in a pamphlet on this very subject; and he found the anomalies of experiment much greater than in this method by weighing.\u2014Indeed the regular progression of weights to be seen in the annexed tables is an unquestionable proof of the sufficiency of the method; and it has the evident advantage of all other methods in point of simplicity and practicability without any uncommon apparatus. Any person possessed of a good ordinary balance and a set of exact weights may examine all questions of this kind, by weighing pure water and the liquor which he may have occasion to examine in a common 6 or 8 ounce phial. For this reason, it is recommended (in preference to all hydrometers) to the board of excise to provide this simple apparatus in every principal office. Every experiment was made at least three times; and the mean result (which never differed one grain from the extreme) was taken. From these experiments the annexed tables were constructed. The first is the simple abstract of the experiments, containing the weights of the contents of the bottle of every mixture. The second contains the specific gravities deduced from them. We have said that the experiments appear surprisingly accurate. This we said on the authority of the regular progression of the specific gravity in any of the horizontal rows. In the series, for instance, for the temperature 62\u00b0, the greatest anomaly is in the mixture of 50 parts of spirit with 100 of water. The specific gravity is 95804, wanting 3 or 4 of the regular progression. This does not amount to 1 in 18000.",

      "text": "Malpighi describes spiral vessels as existing in the ligneous parts of all plants. He called them spiral tubes, because, when extended, they were resolved, not into separate rings, but into a single zone, which might be drawn out to a great length. In general they form continuous tubes, but are sometimes contracted at regular distances, so as to resemble somewhat a series of oblong cells. One of these contracted spiral vessels, as delineated by Malpighi, is represented in fig. 17, Plate XXXVIII., at the extremity of which the spiral filament is in part drawn out; and similar appearances of the spiral structure are exhibited in figures 9 and 10, by Mirbel. In herbs, according to Malpighi, these spiral vessels constantly accompany the common sap-vessels, and are ensheathed by them; in shrubs, they occur in every part of the wood, single or in clusters; and in trees, an intermixture of spiral vessels with the common sap-vessels is observed in every part of the wood. In the fir, they are found immediately beneath the bark, and are so numerous as to constitute the chief bulk of the wood. They exist with the sap-vessels in the petioles and ribs of the leaf, and likewise in the petals of the flower. In the roots they are also met with, and in some roots are so abundant, as to exceed in bulk all the other parts. They exist, he adds, in every part of the plant except the bark; and are annually formed with the alburnous vessels of trees. (Anatom. Plantar. passim.)\n\nFrom the writings of Grew we collect also that of Grew, spiral vessels exist in every part of a plant except the bark. In the root they are numerous, of very various size, and their bore is generally larger than that of the common sap-vessels. In the trunks both of herbs and trees they are equally visible, and in position, size, and number, subject to great variation. Sometimes they are collected into fasciculi, at other times they are disposed in rays, and in other instances they are arranged in a circular form; they stand sometimes next to the pith, in other instances next to the bark, and in other cases again they alternate with the common sap-vessels in every part of the wood. They have a more ample bore than the common vessels, and vary in size to at least twenty different degrees. In the leaf they always accompany the sap-vessels, and both in its petiole and ribs are constantly surrounded or ensheathed by them. They have a similar position in the petals of the flower, and in the vascular parts of the fruit. (Anatomy of Plants, passim.) Hence, then, it appears, from the dissections of Malpighi and Grew, that, in every plant in which vessels are to be seen, and almost in every part of it, spiral vessels abound; they exist, however, only in the lignous portion, or that part in which the sap ascends, and are never to be found in the bark.\n\nBy Du Hamel, the spiral vessels, supposed to con-of Du Ha-vey air, are described as existing in the leaves and the flowers, the petals of which are almost wholly composed of them.

Curt, \"had inspired such veneration for the conical caissons, that those persons who had been most disposed to object to the plan were now obliged to be silent.\" The result of the experiment at once decided the government to commence operations at Cherbourg. M. de Cessart was appointed director of the works, with four engineers to assist him. A permanent council, consisting of commanders in chief, directors, engineers, &c. was ordered to reside for six summer months at Cherbourg, and the other six in Paris; and a considerable body of troops were marched down to the neighbourhood, to furnish a competent number of artificers and labourers, to be employed on this great national undertaking. In 1783 the buildings were commenced for lodging the principal officers of the civil and military departments, and their respective establishments; a naval yard was marked out and inclosed; roads of communication were opened with the forts; and at Becquet, about a league to the eastward of Cherbourg, a small harbour was dug out for the reception of about eighty vessels, which were to be employed in transporting the stones from thence by sea. On the 6th June 1784 the first cone was floated off and sunk, and the second on the 7th July following, in presence of 10,000 spectators, assembled on the shores and quays of Cherbourg; but before the cavity of the latter could be filled with stones, a storm, in the month of August, which continued five days, entirely demolished the upper part of this cone. In the course of this summer the quantity of stones sunk within the cavities of the two cones, outside their bases, and in the intermediate space, amounted to 4600 cubic toises, or about 65,000 tons. In 1785 three more cones were completed and sunk at irregular intervals; and, at the end of that year, the quantity sunk amounted to 17,767 cubic toises, or about 250,000 tons. In 1786 five additional cones were completed and sunk, one of them in presence of the king; and the quantity of stones thrown within them, and deposited on the dike connecting the cones, amounted, at the end of this year, to 42,862 cubic toises, or 600,000 tons. In 1787 five more cones were sunk and filled with stones, making, in the whole, fifteen; and the distance between the first and fifteenth cone was 1203 toises, and the quantity of stones deposited within these cones and the connecting dike, at the end of this year, amounted to 71,385 cubic toises, or more than 1,000,000 tons. The violent gales of wind that are frequent in November and December carried away all the upper parts of the five\ncones which were sunk this year. In 1788 three more were sunk, but the upper parts of the first two were carried away as the others had been; the height of the third was, therefore, reduced, so as to be, when sunk, on a level with low water; but this cone was upset and soon went to pieces. The enormous expense, and the delay that had been occasioned, in completing and sinking these eighteen cones, exhausted the patience of the government, so that in the following year, 1789, it caused the three cones, then on the building slips, to be sold for whatever they would fetch. The total quantity of stone that was sunk within the cones, and on the intermediate dike, from the year 1784 to the end of December 1790, being seven years, amounted to 373,359 cubic toises, or about 5,300,000 tons. These eighteen cones being sunk at irregular distances from each other, some being 25 toises, and others 300 toises from centre to centre, occupied a line of 1950 toises in length. The distance of the first cone from the island Pel\u00e9e, on the east, was 510, and of the eighteenth, to Fort Querqueville, on the west, 1200 toises; so that the whole entrance or opening of the roadstead of Cherbourg was originally 3660 toises, more than one-half of which was now imperfectly covered by the breakwater. The expense of this great undertaking was not, we suspect, accurately known, and could not, probably, be ascertained.",

      "text": "Since similar objections must obviously attach to all gauges employed for this purpose, it would be of little use to give any further account of them, or of the registers of evaporation with which many works otherwise valuable are so often encumbered. It had been long supposed that muriatic acid vapour existed in the atmosphere incumbent over the ocean or on the sea coasts; and various effects were ascribed to its presence. But from experiments detailed in the Journal de Pharmacie for November 1833, it appears that such effects are solely owing to minute drops of salt water or spray which have been swept into the atmosphere by the wind; and that, with the exception of the salt drops thus raised, though only when the sea is ruffled by the wind, sea-air contains neither nitrates nor uncombined muriatic acid. At first sight we had some doubt whether this would account for the injurious effects of sea-air on vegetation; because the presence of common salt, if not in excess, is known to be beneficial. But perhaps the salt when united with the soil may operate as a cordial to the roots, while it may be noxious when in immediate contact with the stem or leaves, as is often the case with manure injudiciously applied close to the roots of plants. In the method of forming ice in India by exposing water during the night to the aspect of a clear sky, the effect was for some time ascribed to evaporation; but Dr Wells ascertained that the water thus exposed gained in place of losing weight. Now it could only gain by being cooled below the dew point of the incumbent air; for it is only in that state that the air could yield a portion of its moisture to the water; and therefore the cold must be the effect of radiation, and not of evaporation. This was farther evident from the circumstance that wind which ought to have increased the evaporation prevented the freezing altogether. But independently of these considerations, water exposed in the open air could never be cooled to the freezing point by evaporation alone in a hot climate. Where such a thing occurs, the air must be unusually dry, even after its temperature scarcely amounts to $40^\\circ$, or the atmospheric pressure must be very small; because the utmost evaporation that can be produced artificially under the ordinary pressure will little more than cool a wet thermometer from $40^\\circ$ to $32^\\circ$; and the cooling effect on a vessel with water is not nearly so great, especially in the open air, if care be taken to avoid the influence of radiation under the aspect of a clear sky. It is true that, at Benares for instance, the surface of the ground, after becoming very cold by radiation, sometimes renders the incumbent still air also pretty cold; but this, by bringing the air to a state of saturation with moisture, totally unfitting it for aiding the freezing by evaporation. So great is the difference of opinion respecting the influence of electricity on evaporation, that we suspect it has not yet been sufficiently investigated. The use of evaporation in the arts and manufactures will be found under the respective articles. In addition to the various works noticed in this article, see Dr Thomas Young's *Natural Philosophy*; Wells on *Deo*; Pouillet's *Elements de Physique et de Meteorologie*. A variety of articles on this subject will be found in the different volumes of the *Philosophical Transactions*, and other scientific journals. (e.e.e.)",

      "text": "They say that this metaphysical argument receives complete confirmation (if confirmation of an intuitive truth be necessary) from the most familiar observation. We see that all motions, however violent, terminate in rest; and that the continual exertion of some force is necessary for their continuance.\n\n23. These philosophers therefore assert, that the continual action of the moving cause is essentially necessary for the continuance of the motion; but they differ among themselves in their notions and opinions about this cause. Some maintain that all the motions in the universe are produced and continued by the immediate agency of Deity; others affirm, that in every particle of matter there is inherent a sort of mind, the \\(\\phi\\alpha\\sigma\\tau\\eta\\gamma\\) of Aristotle, which they call an Elemental Mind, which is the cause of all its motions and changes. An overwhelming reverence for Greek learning has had a great influence in reviving this doctrine of Aristotle. The Greek and Roman languages are affirmed to be more accurate expressions of human thought than the modern languages are. In those ancient languages, the verbs which express motion are employed both in the active and passive voice; whereas we have only the active verb to move, for expressing both the state of motion and the act of putting in motion. \"The stone moves down the slope, and moves all the pebbles which lie in its way;\" but in the ancient lan-\nFirst Law guages, the mere state of motion is always expressed by\nof Motion, the passive or middle voice. The accurate conception of\nthe speakers is therefore extolled. The state of motion is\nexpressed as it ought to be, as the result of a continual\naction. Kontrai, movetur, is equivalent to \"it is moved.\"\nAccording to these philosophers, everything which moves\nis mind, and every thing that is moved is body.\n\nThe argument is futile, and it is false; for the modern\nlanguages are, in general, equally accurate in this instance:\n\"se mouvoir,\" in French; \"fich bewegen,\" in German;\n\"deigatun,\" in Slavonic; are all passive or reflected. And\nthe ancients said that \"rain falls, water runs, smoke rises,\"\njust as we do. The ingenious author of Ancient Meta-\nphysics has taken much pains to give us, at length, the\nprocedures of those elementary minds in producing the\nostensible phenomena of local motion; but it seems to be\nmerely an abuse of language, and a very frivolous abuse.\nThis elemental mind is known and characterised only by\nthe effect which we ascribe to its action; that is, by the\nmotions or changes of motions. Uniform and unexpec-\nted experience shows us that these are regulated by laws\nas precise as those of mathematical truth. We consider\nnothing as more fixed and determined than the common\nlaws of mechanism. There is nothing here that indicates\nany thing like spontaneity, intention, purpose; none of\nthose marks by which mind was first brought into view;\nbut they are very like the effects which we produce by\nthe exertions of our corporeal forces; and we have ac-\ncordingly given the name force to the causes of motion.\nIt is surely much more apposite than the name mind, and\nconveys with much more readiness and perspicuity the\nvery notions that we wish to convey.\n\n24.

There are, however, several other bodies, some of them remarkable on account of their splendour, which, besides participating in the general motion, have peculiar motions of their own, and are incessantly shifting their positions among the fixed stars. An attentive observation of the state of the sky during a few successive evenings, will suffice to show that there are some stars which have in the mean time changed their places; and, on continuing to observe them, they will be found to separate themselves from particular constellations, and gradually but imperceptibly to approach others, till they at length appear, after unequal intervals of time, in an opposite quarter of the heavens. From this circumstance they were designated by the Greeks Planets, that is, wandering stars, in contradistinction to those which obey only the law of the diurnal motion.

Many a savage may have been born with as good faculties as a Newton, a Bacon, or an Aristotle; but their talents were buried by having never been put to use, whilst those of the philosophers were cultivated to the best advantage. It may likewise be observed, that the chief mean of improving our Utility of rational power, is the vigorous exercise of it in various ways, and on different subjects, by which the habit is acquired of exercising it properly. Without such exercise, and good sense over and above, a man who has studied logic all his life may be only a petulant wrangler, without true judgment or skill of reasoning in any science.\"\n\nThis must have been Mr Locke's meaning, when, in his Thoughts on Education, he says, \"If you would have your son to reason well, let him read Chillingworth.\" The state of things is much altered since Locke wrote. Logic has been much improved chiefly by his writings; and yet much less stress is laid upon it, and much less time consumed in its study, than formerly. His counsel, therefore, was judicious and seasonable, viz. That the improvement of our reasoning powers is to be expected much more from an intimate acquaintance with the authors who reason best, than from studying voluminous systems of scholastic logic. But if he had meant, that the study of logic was of no use, nor deserved any attention, he surely would not have taken the pains to make so considerable an addition to it, by his Essay concerning Human Understanding, and by his Thoughts on the Conduct of the Understanding; nor would he have remitted his pupil to Chillingworth, the acutest logician as well as the best reasoner of his age. It must indeed be confessed, that a man without knowing the rules of logic may acquire a habit of reasoning justly in mathematics, and perhaps in any other science. Good sense, good examples, and assiduous exercise, may bring a man to reason justly and acutely in his own profession without rules. But whoever thinks, that from this concession he may infer the inutility of logic, betrays by this inference a great want of sense; for he might as well infer that, because a man may go from Edinburgh to London by the way of Paris, therefore any other road is useless. There is perhaps no art which may not be acquired in a very considerable degree, by example and practice, without reducing it to rules.",

      "text": "Metaphysics has been defined, by a writer deeply versed in the ancient philosophy, \"the science of the principles and causes of all things existing.\" This definition we think extremely proper; and hence it is, that mind or intelligence, and especially the Supreme Intelligence, which is the cause of the universe, and of every thing which it contains, is the principal subject of this science; and hence, too, the science itself has received its name. Aristotle, indeed, who, of all the ancient metaphysicians whose works have come down to us, was unquestionably the greatest, calls this science the First Philosophy, as being not only superior, but also prior in the order of nature, to the whole circle of the arts and sciences. But what is first in nature is not first to man. Nature begins with causes, which produce effects. Man begins with effects, and by them ascends to causes. Thus all human study and investigation proceed of necessity in the reverse of the natural order of things, from sensible to intelligible, from body to effect, to mind, which is both the first and the final cause.\n\nNow Physics being the name given by the Stagyrite to the philosophy of body, some of his interpreters, from this necessary course of human studies, called that of mind Metaphysics; implying by that term not only that its subject is more sublime and difficult, but also that the study of it would be most properly and successfully entered upon after that of physics. To this name, which, though it has sometimes been treated with ridicule, is abundantly significant, the followers of Aristotle were led by their master, who, to the books in which he pretends to elevate the mind above things corporeal to the contemplation of God and things spiritual, prefixed the Greek words \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u1f70 \u03c6\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac.\n\nThe science of Metaphysics has been divided, according to the objects which it considers, into six principal parts, which are denominated: 1. Ontology; 2. Cosmology; 3. Anthroposophy; 4. Psychology; 5. Pneumatology; and, 6. Metaphysical Theology.\n\nOntology. ",

The extremity of this key was furnished with a screw, to which could be affixed a hook, or a variety of pieces for supporting what was to be examined in the receiver, or for producing various motions within it, without admitting the air. This was farther guarded against by means of oil poured round the key, where it was retained by the hollow cup-like form of the cover. With all these precautions, however, Mr. Boyle ingenuously confesses, that it was but seldom, and with great difficulty, that he could produce an extreme degree of rarefaction; and it appears by Guericke's letter to Schottus that in this respect the Magdeburgh machine had the advantage. But most of Boyle's very interesting experiments did not require this extreme rarefaction; and the variety of them, and their philosophic importance, compensated for this defect, and soon eclipsed the fame of the inventor to such a degree, that the state of air in the receiver was generally denominated the vacuum Boyleanum, and the air-pump was called machina Boyleana. Mr. Boyle found, that to make a vessel air-tight, it was sufficient to place a piece of wet or oiled leather on its brim, and to lay a flat plate of metal on this. The pressure of the external air squeezed the two solid bodies so hard together, that the soft leather effectually excluded it. This enabled him to render the whole machine incomparably more convenient for a variety of experiments. He caused the conduit-pipe to terminate in a flat plate which he covered with leather, and on this he set the glass bell or receiver, which had both its upper and lower brim ground flat. He covered the upper orifice in like manner with a piece of oiled leather and a flat plate, having cocks and a variety of other perforations and contrivances suited to his purposes. This he found infinitely more expeditions, and also tighter than the clammy cements which he had formerly used for securing the joints. He was now assisted by Dr. Hooke, the most ingenious and inventive mechanic that the world has ever seen. This person made a great improvement on the air-pump, by applying two syringes AA (fig. 19), whose pistons P and P' are both worked by one wheel O pitching in the racks or piston rods R and R', the pistons being thus raised and depressed alternately by turning the winch W backwards and forwards. In the bottom of each of the barrels there is an opening communicating with the receiver or bell glass B, placed on the plate A (fig.",

Likewise, for the benefit of commerce, it is provided by statute 4 Geo. III. c. 33, that any trader, having privilege of parliament, may be served with legal process for any just debt to the amount of L100; and, unless he make satisfaction within two months, it shall be deemed an act of bankruptcy; and commissions of bankruptcy may be issued against such privileged traders, in like manner as against any other. The only way by which courts of justice could anciently take cognizance of privilege of parliament was by writ of privilege, in the nature of a supersedeas, to deliver the party out of custody when arrested in a civil suit. For when a letter was written by the speaker to the judges to stay proceedings against a privileged person, they rejected it, as contrary to their oath of office. But since the statute 12 William III. c. 3, which enacts, that no privileged person shall be subject to arrest or imprisonment, it has been held that such arrest is irregular ab initio, and that the party may be discharged upon motion. It is to be observed, that there is no precedent of any such writ of privilege, but only in civil suits; and that the statute of 1 Jac. I. c. 13, and that of William III., which remedy some inconveniences arising from privilege of parliament, speak only of civil actions. Therefore the claim of privilege has usually\nbeen guarded with an exception as to the case of indictable crimes; or, as it has been frequently expressed, of treason, felony, and breach of the peace. Hence it seems to have been understood that no privilege was allowable to the members, their families, or servants, in any crime whatsoever; for all crimes are treated by the law as being contra pacem domini regis. Instances have not been wanting in which privileged persons have been convicted of misdemeanors, and committed, or prosecuted to outlawry, even in the middle of a session; proceedings which have afterwards received the sanction and approbation of parliament. To this it may be added, that the case of writing and publishing seditious libels was resolved by both houses not to be entitled to privilege; and the reasons upon which that case proceeded extended equally to every indictable offence. Thus the chief, if not the only privilege of parliament, in such cases, seems to be the right of receiving immediate information of the imprisonment or detention of any member, with the reason for which he is detained; a practice that is daily used upon the slightest military accusations, preparatory to a trial by a court martial, and which is recognised by the several temporary statutes for suspending the habeas corpus act, by which it is provided, that no member of either house shall be detained, till the matter of which he stands suspected be first communicated to the house of which he is a member, and the consent of the said house obtained for his commitment or detaining. But ever since the Revolution the usage has uniformly been to make the communication subsequently to the arrest. 4. For the despatch of business, each house of parliament has its speaker. The speaker of the House of Lords, whose office it is to preside there, and manage the formality of business, is the Lord Chancellor, or keeper of the king's great seal, or any other appointed by the king's commission; and if none be so appointed, the House of Lords may elect their own speaker. The speaker of the House of Commons is chosen by the house, but must be approved by the king. And herein the usage of the two houses differs. The speaker of the House of Commons cannot give his opinion or argue any question in the house; but the speaker of the House of Lords, if a lord of parliament, may do so. In each house the act of the majority binds the whole; and this majority is declared by votes openly and publicly given, not, as in Venice, and many other senatorial assemblies, privately or by ballot. The latter method may be serviceable, to prevent intrigues and unconstitutional combinations; but it is impossible to be practised with us, at least in the House of Commons, where every member's conduct is subject to the future censure of his constituents, and therefore should be openly submitted to their inspection. 5. It now only remains to add a word or two concerning the manner in which parliament may be adjourned, prorogued, or dissolved. An adjournment is no more than a continuance of the session from one day to another, as the word itself signifies; and this is done by the authority of each ho",

In the case of wheat and oats, when the grains have ceased to yield a milky fluid on being pressed under the thumb-nail, and when the ears and a few inches of the stem immediately under them have become yellow, the sooner they are reaped the better. Barley requires to be somewhat more matured. Unless the pink stripes on the husk have disappeared, and the grain has acquired a firm substance, it will shrink in drying, and be deficient both in weight and colour. When allowed to stand till it gets curved in the neck, the straw of barley becomes so brittle that many ears break short off in the reaping; and it suffers even more than other grain-crops under a shaking wind.\n\nIt is of great consequence to see that corn is dry when it is tied up in sheaves; that these are not too tightly bound, and that every sheaf is kept constantly on foot. From the increased demand for harvest labourers, and the rapidity with which operations must be carried forward, stooking is not now performed with the same accuracy that it was wont to be. There is therefore the greater need for employing a person to review the stooks daily, and keep every sheaf erect. It was formerly the practice in Scotland to set up oats and barley in full stooks of twelve sheaves each, viz., five pairs and two hood-sheaves. These hood-sheaves are an excellent defence when wet weather sets in, but they retard the drying of the corn in fine weather, and there are now few binders who can set them up so as to stand securely. It is better, therefore, to aim at rapid drying, and, for this purpose, to have the sheaves small individually, and to set but four or six of them together. Large sheaves are worse to dry than small ones, not only from their greater bulk, but from their being almost invariably tighter bound. The utmost vigilance is required on the part of farmers to avoid this fault. Beans and peas are reaped by the sickle. The former are usually not bound into sheaves at once, but left prostrate in handfuls for a few days until they have withered a little. They are then sheaved, and bound with ties of twisted straw, which must be provided beforehand. In stacking beans, the tops of the sheaves are kept outwards, as by this means fewer pods are exposed to the weather, or to the depredations of fowls, &c., than when the butts are to the outside. Pease are rolled into wisps as they are reaped, and afterwards turned daily until they are fit to carry. When stacked, they must instantly be thatched, as they take in wet like a sponge. It requires no little discrimination to know when sheaves are dry enough to keep in a stack. The farmer finds it for his profit to consult his most intelligent and experienced labourers on this point. On thrusting the hand into a sheaf sufficiently dried, there is a lightness and kindliness to the touch not easily mistaken when once understood. Whenever this is ascertained, the crop is carried with the utmost possible despatch. This is best accomplished by using one-horse carts, and by building the sheaves into round stacks of ten or twelve loads each. Very large stacks are for ostentation, not for profit. The labour of pitching up the sheaves to them is needlessly great; corn is much sooner in a state to keep in small stacks than in large ones, and sooner gets into condition for market; the crop is more accessible for thrashing in ten-load quantities than in huge ricks, and the crop of different fields and kinds of grain more easily kept separate.\n\n",

The last method has the advantage of preventing the loss of light by reflection from the first surface of the tourmaline, and removing any imperfection of polish that it may have.

This polarized light may be obtained either from light reflected at an angle of 56\u00b0 from a plate of black glass, or from a bundle of plates of crown or flint glass, or mica (properly placed), or by transmission through a bundle of such plates, or from one of the images of a rhomb of calcareous spar.\n\nWhen this light is obtained, the observer holds the microscope AB in his right hand, and examines through it the object in his left hand, turning AB slightly round, so as to bring it into the position in which it refuses to transmit any of the polarized light which passes through the object, and towards which, of course, the observer's eye is directed. When this is done, the peculiar structure of the object will depolarize or alter the polarization of part of the incident light; and this light, being no longer polarized, will pass through the plate of tourmaline to the eye, and exhibit on a dark ground, and in luminous and often beautifully coloured lines, the structure of the body.\n\nIf the body is transparent, and not flat, it may be advantageously placed in a little glass trough containing water or oil, or a fluid of the same refracting power as the body, so that the polarized light may be made to pass through it in all directions, and exhibit its entire structure.\n\nWhen the shape and surface of the body present no difficulties, the best method is to stick it by a transparent cement, or simply to place it upon a plate of tourmaline held in the left hand. The observer thus carries the polarizer and the object in his left hand, and in his right the magnifier and the analyzer.\n\nWhen a second plate of tourmaline is not at hand, the object may be placed upon a rhomb of calcareous spar, above one of the images which that rhomb forms of a circular aperture on its lower or farther side, the light of the other image being stopped out by a piece of water.\n\nWhen a small lens is needed, and strong light can be commanded, the magnifier and the analyzer may be united in one by making the magnifying lens of tourmaline.\n\nWhen microscopic doublets or triplets are used, the plate of tourmaline may be placed between two of the lenses, and cemented to the plane side of any of the plano-convex lenses.\n\nCompound Polarizing Microscope.\n\n",

      "text": "iv., p. 556.)\n\nFrance.\u2014D'Arcy gives the following as the type of the rocks of this period in the basin of the Seine:\n\n- Green and ferruginous sand. - Clay, with Pterodactylus and *Eoxygenia* sinuata. - Variegated sands and sandy clays, with iron ore. - Clays, with oyster shells, &c. - Neocomian limestone and blue marl. - White sand and ferruginous sand, with iron goosends. He says that these groups overlap each other from east to west, but that the upper group (C) also spreads much more widely than the rest from north to south. The following continental names for groups of rock belong to this part of the period, being more or less nearly contemporary with Lower Greensand:\u2014Hils clay and Hils conglomerate; Biancone; Spatangus and *Exogyra* limestone; Marls of Hautvive; Terrain Urgonien, or \"premier zone de rudistes;\" and Terrain Aptien, or argile \u00e0 plicatures of D'Orbigny; the Hippurite limestone, &c. Upper Cretaceous Beds.\u2014We may now proceed to the examination of the Upper Cretaceous beds of our original area. 3. Gault.\u2014This is a stiff dark-gray, blue, or brown clay, often used for brick-making. It can be seen very well at Cambridge and at Folkestone, but is by no means invariably present. The shells in it are often beautifully preserved, having been well packed and protected from atmospheric or other influences. Mr Sharpe was inclined to the opinion that the sands of Blackdown were of the same age as the Gault, being the littoral deposits of the same sea, in the deeper parts of which the clay was deposited. 4. Upper Greensand.\u2014This set of beds often resembles the Lower Greensand in lithological character, but the same caution is to be used in taking its designation for a name only, and not for a description. The sands are by no means always green, and other sands, especially some Tertiary sands, are to be found quite as green, or greener, than those which have received the name of Greensand. Beds and concretionary masses of calcareous grit occur in it, sometimes called firestone, sometimes malm rock. Concretions, probably coprolitic, containing phosphate of lime, also occur, and are valuable to the agriculturist. It has been surmised that the Upper Greensand may be in part a shore deposit, and therefore contemporaneous with, rather than preceding, the lowest beds of the chalk, but wherever the two are together, we always find the Upper Greensand underneath the Chalk Marl. 5. Chalk Marl.\u2014The top of the Upper Greensand becomes argillaceous, and passes upwards into a pale buff-coloured marl or argillaceous limestone, sometimes of sufficient consistency to be used as a building stone. This in its higher portion begins to lose the argillaceous character, and gradually passes into the soft white pulverulent limestone familiar to every one as chalk. 6. White Chalk without flints.\u2014This is a great mass of soft and often pulverulent limestone, thick-bedded, the stratification often obscure, partly by the obliteration of the bedding planes, partly by the abundance of quadrangular and diagonal joints, the surfaces of which are often weather-stained, dirty-green, or yellow. Nodular balls of iron pyrites, radiated internally, are frequent in it, and produce rusty stains about the rock.",

The authorities refer it to years ranging from 384 to 380 B.C.; the fixed point being, that it took place in the ninety-ninth Olympiad. His enemies used to taunt him with his barbaric pedigree. His maternal grandfather, Gylon, had been charged with betraying a fort in the Crimea (the Tauric Chersonesus), and, being driven into exile, had married a woman of foreign blood. The orator's father, whose name he inherited, was an Athenian citizen, extensively engaged in manufacture and commerce, and entered in the richest class on the tax rolls. Demosthenes was left an orphan between his fifth and his tenth year; and the affairs of himself and his sister were entrusted to three guardians, two of them kinsmen, from whom, after attaining his legal majority at the age of sixteen, he long endeavoured in vain to extort a reckoning. The property which in the end he was able to recover, saved him from being poor, but was not enough to make him by any means wealthy. He is said to have been first directed towards the study of oratory, by the necessity which he speedily foresaw of having to institute a law-suit against his guardians; for the Athenian forms of procedure did not, unless in cases of special exemption, allow litigants in private causes to plead in the courts otherwise than in person. At any rate, Demosthenes did so plead for himself in those matters, in three, or perhaps five, orations, still extant; besides delivering, long afterwards, in another personal suit, his energetic invective against Midias. The composition, also, for payment, of speeches to be delivered by litigants, was a part of the ordinary business of advocates or orators at Athens; and the state of his affairs, together, perhaps, with the desire of thus training himself better for political eloquence, led him to occupy himself much in this way, especially in the earlier part of his public life. Such occasions gave rise to a considerable number of the speeches which are preserved among his works. He gave instructions in oratory, likewise, as we gather from the sneers of \u00c6schines.\n\n",

      "text": "This dial is represented by fig. 4, Plate CCI. It shows the hour of the day, the sun's place in the ecliptic, and his altitude at the time of observation. The dial is constructed by tracing the lines on a rectangular piece of paper (fig. 5), and pasting it on the surface of the cylinder. The lines may be traced by the following rules. Having formed on paper a rectangle ABDC, of such a size that, when wrapped round the cylinder, its opposite sides AC, BD, may just coincide; produce the side BA to e, any convenient distance, and on a as a centre, with the distance aA, describe the quadrantal arc AE, and divide it into ninety equal parts for degrees; draw lines from the centre through as many divisions of the quadrant as there are degrees of the sun's altitude in the longest day of the year at noon of the place for which the dial is to serve, which at London is 62\u00b0, and continue these lines until they meet the tangent line AC. From the points of meeting draw lines across the rectangle parallel to AB, as shown in the figure, and these will be the parallels of the sun's altitude, in whole degrees, from sunrise to sunset, on all the days of the year. Divide AB, CD, the top and bottom sides of the rectangle, into twelve equal parts for the signs of the ecliptic, and draw straight lines, joining the points of division, on which, at the bottom, place the characters of the signs, as in the figure. The twelve divisions should be subdivided by parallel lines into halves, and, if there be room, into quarters. At the top of the rectangle make a scale of the months and days of the year, so as that the division of the scale for each day may stand over the division for the sun's place on that day in the scale of signs. The sun's place in the ecliptic each day of the year 1830, the second after leap year, is given at the end of this article, and may serve for this scale. Compute the sun's altitude for every hour in the latitude of the place, when he is in the beginning and middle of each sign, and in the upright parallel lines make marks for these computed altitudes among the parallels of altitude, reckoning them downward according to the order of the numeral figures set to them along the side BD, answering to the divisions of the quadrant on the opposite side; and through these marks draw the curve hour lines, and set the hours to them, as in the figure, reckoning the forenoon hours downwards, and the afternoon hours upwards. The sun's altitude should also be computed for the half hours; as to the quarter hour points, they may be put nearly in their proper place by estimation with the eye. The scales and hour lines being constructed, the part of the paper on which the quadrant was drawn is to be cut off along the line AC, and that on the opposite side along BD. The superfluous parts at the top and bottom are also to be removed, and it will be fit for being pasted round the cylinder. The cylinder, reduced in size, is represented by ABCD, fig. 4. It should be hollow, to hold the style DEe when it is not used. The crooked end of the style is put into a hole in the top AD of the cylinder, which fits on it tightly, and may be turned round, like the lid of a paper snuff-box. The style must stand straight out, perpendicular to the side of the cylinder, just over the line AB, round the top from which the parallels of the sun's altitude are reckoned; and the length of the style, projecting beyond the cylinder, must be exactly equal to Aa, the radius of the quadrant in fig. 5. To use the dial, place the base of the cylinder on a level table where the sun shines, and turn the top round till the style stand directly over the day of the month; then turn\nDialling. The cylinder about on the table till the shadow falls on it parallel to those upright lines which divide the signs, that is, till the shadow be parallel to the (supposed) axis of the cylinder; and then the point or lowest shadow will fall upon the time of the day among the curve hour lines, and will show the sun's altitude at that time, among the cross parallels of its altitude which go round the cylinder; at the same time it will indicate the sign of the ecliptic in which the sun is. The dial may also, when used, be suspended by the ring F in its top.",

In early times only equals would submit their differences to the decision of neutral persons, or consent to rule their relationships by contract, because only equals had a common interest in obtaining the settlement of their differences by these means. Equity then entered into all decisions and contracts in early times, and thence into the rules of custom derived from them, and into law, so far as it is an organic growth from the constitution and circumstances of a people. A distinction, already hinted at, must here be brought out between customs due to the intercourse of equals and those due to the intercourse of superiors and inferiors. It was said that from the latter arose no principles for imitation by equals in forming relationships between themselves. It may now be said, that the latter class of customs are permissive and not regulating, and are only for consideration here as illustrating the condition of things from which law gradually rescues men. All the customs that shock one's sense of justice and humanity,\u2014the exposition of infants\u2014the powers of a Roman father over his children,\u2014are remnants of the condition anterior to law, and respect acts and relationships not rescued from that condition, because they lay without the sphere of operation of the causes by which law has everywhere been developed. They are proofs of the slowness of men to extend, by sympathy, to others benefits which, by force, they assert for themselves. That sympathy is among the causes which develop law is certain; but it is only by concurrence with a highly stimulated selfishness that it recovers the relations of superiors and inferiors from arbitrary rule. It is owing to this that law has been, almost everywhere, developed in some degree differently with respect to different classes of the same people. When it was first asserted in cities that law ought to be equal for all, the claim was advanced only for the classes of freemen, who were themselves the parties making it; at first\n\n\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd, \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03bd, immigrants, helots, and slaves of every kind, were disallowed equal privileges.

But while this performance raised his fame, it did not add to his happiness, for it alienated friends, and made foes of those formerly indifferent. In 1790 Dr Parr got involved in an obscure and intricate controversy respecting the authorship of the Bampton Lectures published by Dr White, who seems, together with his coadjutors, to have been guilty of plagiarism.\n\nThe Tracts by Warburton and a Warburtonian, not admitted into the collection of their respective works, appeared in 1789, with a dedication addressed by the editor to a learned critic, containing some excellent critical remarks, and abounding at the same time in forcible expression and happy illustration. Of this composition, which it is to be feared was written more with the design of annoying Bishop Hurd, the editor of Warburton, than with any higher motive, Warton is reported to have said, that if he were called upon to point out some of the finest sentences in English prose, he would quote Parr's preface and dedication of the Warburtonian Tracts.\n\nThe Birmingham riots of 1791 called forth the Sequel to the printed Paper lately circulated in Warwickshire by the Rev. Charles Curtis, brother of Alderman Curtis, a Birmingham Rector, London, 1792; and A Letter from Irenopolis to the Inhabitants of Eleutheropolis, or a Serious Address to the Dissenters of Birmingham; both admirable specimens of the author's spirited and elegant style. In 1793 a violent pamphlet by Dr Combe occasioned Remarks on the Statement of Dr Charles Combe, by an occasional writer in the British Critic, 1793, written in a temperate, calm, and guarded tone. Parr's famous Spital Sermon of 1800 brought him into collision with Godwin and others of the opposite school of morals.\n\nIn 1802 Sir Francis Burdett presented him to the rectory of Graffham in Huntingdonshire. His last publication that is entitled to particular notice is, Characters of the late Charles James Fox, selected, and in part written, by Philopatris Vareicensis, which appeared in 1809.

      "text": "Horsley's edition. and forced to describe a curve like a projectile at the surface of the earth?\u00b9\n\nHere another consideration very naturally occurred. Though gravity be not sensibly weakened at the small distances from the surface to which our experiments extend, it may be weakened at greater distances, and at the moon may be greatly diminished. To estimate the quantity of this diminution, Newton appears to have reasoned thus: If the moon be retained in her orbit by her gravitation to the earth, it is probable that the planets are, in like manner, carried round the sun by a power of the same kind with gravity, directed to the centre of that luminary. He proceeded, therefore, to inquire by what law the tendency or gravitation of the planets to the sun must diminish, in order that, describing, as they do, orbits nearly circular round the sun, their times of revolution and their distances may have the relation to one another which they are known to have from observation, or from the third law of Kepler. This was an investigation which, to most even of the philosophers and mathematicians of that age, would have proved an insurmountable obstacle to their further progress; but Newton was too familiar with the geometry of evanescent or infinitely small quantities, not to discover very soon that the law now referred to would require the force of gravity to diminish exactly as the square of the distance increased. The moon, therefore, being distant from the earth about sixty semidiameters of the earth, the force of gravity at that distance must be reduced to the 3600th part of what it is at the earth's surface. Was the deflection of the moon then from the tangent of her orbit, in a second of time, just the 3600th part of the distance which a heavy body falls in a second at the surface of the earth? This was a question that could be precisely answered, supposing the moon's distance known, not merely in semidiameters of the earth, but in feet, and her angular velocity, or the time of her revolution in her orbit, to be also known. In this calculation, however, being at a distance from books, he took the common estimation of the earth's circumference that was in use before the measurement of Norwood or of the French Academicians, according to which a degree is held equal to 60 English miles. This being in reality a very erroneous supposition, the result of the calculation did not represent the force as adequate to the supposed effect; whence Newton concluded that some other cause than gravity must act on the moon, and on that account he laid aside, for the time, all further speculation on the subject. It was in the true spirit of philosophy that he so readily gave up an hypothesis, in which he could not but feel some interest, the moment he found it at variance with observation. He was sensible that nothing but the exact coincidence of the things compared could establish the conclusion he meant to deduce, or authorize him to proceed with the superstructure, for which it was to serve as the foundation. It appears, that it was not till some years after this that his attention was called to the same subject, by a letter from Dr Hooke, proposing, as a question, To determine the line in which a body let fall from a height descends to the ground, taking into consideration the motion of the earth on its axis. This induced him to resume the subject of the moon's motion; and the measure of a degree by Norwood having now furnished more exact data, he found that his calculation gave the precise quantity for the moon's momentary deflection from the tangent of her orbit, which was deduced from astronomical observation. The moon, therefore, has a tendency to descend toward the earth, from the same cause that a stone at its surface has; and if the descent of the stone in a second be diminished in the ratio of 1 to 3600, it will give the quantity by which the moon descends in a second, below the tangent to her orbit; and thus is obtained an experimental proof of the fact, that gravity decreases as the square of the distance increases. He had already found that the times of the planetary revolutions, supposing their orbits to be circular, led to the same conclusion; and he now proceeded, with a view to the solution of Hooke's problem, to inquire what their orbits must be, supposing the centripetal\n\n\u00b9 Pemberton's View of Newton's Philosophy, Pref. force to be inversely as the square of the distance, and the initial or projectile force to be any whatsoever. On this subject, Pemberton says, he composed (as he calls it) a dozen propositions, which probably were the same with those in the beginning of the Principia,\u2014such as the description of equal areas in equal times, about the centre of force, and the ellipticity of the orbits described under the influence of a centripetal force that varied inversely as the squares of the distances. What seems very difficult to be explained is, that after having made trial of his strength, and of the power of the instruments of investigation which he was now in possession of, and had entered by means of them on the noblest and most magnificent field of investigation that was ever yet opened to any of the human race, he again desisted from the pursuit, so that it was not till several years afterwards that the conversation of Dr Halley, who made him a visit at Cambridge, induced him to resume and extend his researches. He then found, that the three great facts in astronomy, which form the laws of Kepler, gave the most complete evidence to the system of gravitation. The first of them, the proportionality of the areas described by the radius vector to the times in which they are described, is the peculiar character of the motions produced by an original impulse impressed on a body, combined with a centripetal force continually urging it to a given centre. The second law, that the planets describe ellipses, having the sun in one of the foci, common to them all, coincides with this proposition, that a body under the influence of a centripetal force, varying as the square of the distance inversely, and having any projectile force whatever originally impressed on it, must describe a conic section having one focus in the centre of force, which section, if the projectile force does not exceed a certain limit, will become an ellipse. The third law, that the squares of the periodic times are as the cubes of the distances, is a property which belongs to the bodies describing elliptic orbits under the conditions just stated. Thus the three great truths to which the astronomy of the planets had been reduced by Kepler, were all explained in the most satisfactory manner, by the supposition that the planets gravitate to the sun with a force which varies in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances. It added much to this evidence, that the observations of Cassini had proved the same laws to prevail among the satellites of Jupiter. But did the principle which appeared thus to unite the great bodies of the universe act only on those bodies? Did it reside merely in their centres, or was it a force common to all the particles of matter? Was it a fact that every particle of matter had a tendency to unite with every other? Or was that tendency directed only to particular centres? It could hardly be doubted that the tendency was common to all the particles of matter. The centres of the great bodies had no properties as mathematical points; they had none but what they derived from the material particles distributed around them. But the question admitted of being brought to a better test than that of such general reasoning as the preceding. The bodies between which this tendency had been observed to take place were all round bodies, and either spherical or nearly so; but whether great or small, they seemed to gravitate toward one another according to the same law. The planets gravitated to the sun, the moon to the earth, the satellites of Jupiter toward Jupiter; and gravity, in all these instances, varied inversely as the squares of the distances. Were the bodies ever so small\u2014were they mere particles\u2014provided only they were round, it was therefore safe to infer, that they would tend to unite with forces inversely as the squares of the distances. It was probable, then, that gravity was the mutual tendency of all the particles of matter toward one another; but this could not be concluded with certainty, till it was found whether great spherical bodies, composed of particles gravitating according to this law, would themselves gravitate according to the same. Perhaps no man of that age but Newton himself was fit to undertake the solution of this problem. His analysis, either in the form of fluxions or in that of prime and ultimate ratios, was able to reduce it to the quadrature of curves; and he then found, no doubt infinitely to his satisfaction, that the law was the same for the sphere as\nfor the particles which compose it; that the gravitation was directed to the centre of the sphere, and was as the quantity of matter contained in it, divided by the square of the distance from its centre. Thus a complete expression was obtained for the law of gravity, involving both the conditions on which it must depend, the quantity of matter in the gravitating bodies, and the distance at which the bodies were placed. There could be no doubt that this tendency was always mutual, as there appeared nowhere any exception to the rule that action and re-action are equal; so that if a stone gravitated to the earth, the earth gravitated equally to the stone; that is to say, the two bodies tended to approach one another with velocities which were inversely as their quantities of matter.\\(^1\\) There appeared to be no limit to the distance to which this action reached; it was a force that united all the parts of matter to one another; and if it appeared to be particularly directed to certain points, such as the centres of the sun or of the planets, it was only on account of the quantity of matter collected and distributed uniformly round those points, through which, therefore, the force resulting from the composition of all those elements must pass either accurately or nearly. A remarkable inference was deduced from this view of the planetary motions, giving a deep insight into the constitution of our system in a matter that seems the most recondite, and the farthest beyond the sphere which necessarily circumscribes human knowledge. The quantity of matter, and even the density of the planets, was determined. We have seen how Newton compared the intensity of gravitation at the surface of the earth with its intensity at the moon; and by a computation somewhat similar, he compared the intensity of the earth's gravitation to the sun with the moon's gravitation to the earth, each being measured by the contemporaneous and momentary deflection from a tangent to the small arch of its orbit. A more detailed investigation showed, that the intensity of the central force in different orbits is as the mean distance divided by the square of the periodic time; and the same intensity being also as the quantities of matter divided by the squares of the distances, it follows that these two quotients are equal to one another, and that, therefore, the quantities of matter are as the mean distances divided by the squares of the periodic times. Supposing, therefore, in the instance just mentioned, that the ratio of the mean distance of the sun from the earth to the mean distance of the moon from the earth is given (which it is from astronomical observation); as the ratio of their periodic lines is also known, the ratio of the quantity of matter in the sun to the quantity of matter in the earth, of consequence, is found; and the same holds good for all the planets which have satellites moving round them. Nothing certainly can be more unexpected than that the quantities of matter in bodies so remote should admit of being compared with one another, and with the earth. Hence also their mean densities, or mean specific gravities, became known. For from their distances and the angles they subtended, both known from observation, their magnitudes or cubical contents were easily inferred; and the densities of all bodies are, as their quantities of matter, divided by their magnitude.

      "text": "Perhaps, however, they presume too much on the ignorance and gullibility of their auditors. That the paralysing influence of these taxes would be experienced, in the first instance, by capitalists and men of property, is most true; but you cannot injure them without at the same time injuring those who depend upon them. The welfare of the one class rests on that of the other; and to separate them even in imagination, infers a total ignorance of the most obvious principles.\n\nIt is of little use, after these decisive considerations, to dwell on others. But it is obvious that the project for the last taxing property, supposing it were to be carried into effect, would entirely subvert the relations that at present exist among the various ranks and classes of the community. Suppose that the same sums that have been laid out on the education and training of lawyers and physicians, who are making certain incomes by their professions, have been vested by other parties in land or businesses that yield an equal annual rent or profit. Where, may we ask, would be the justice or common sense of taxing the landlords and tradesmen, and exempting the professional men? Because, we shall be told, the property of the former is realised and tangible, which that of the latter is not! But though the best, or rather the only one that can be given, this answer will not bear handling. Probably, indeed, the incomes of the lawyers and physicians may be as well secured as those of the others. They are, no doubt, exposed to accidents and casualties; but so are estates, ships, mines, railways, and most descriptions of property; and the same system of insurance that makes some provision against contingencies happening to the latter, will also help to provide against those that happen to the former. Nothing, therefore, could be more unjust than the proposed plan, were it practicable, which, happily, it is not, to act upon it. It would exempt certain classes of persons from burdens, to impose them on other classes who are equally entitled to protection, and who, it is needless to add, should only bear their fair share of the general burden. A bishop with a palace and L5,000 or L10,000 a year, a lord chancellor, a chief-justice, or a field-marshal may have no property; and under this precious project these high functionaries would enjoy an immunity from that taxation which is to fall with its full weight on the owner of a cottage or patch of land, the depositor of a few pounds in a savings bank, or the annuitant deriving a pittance from an investment in the funds.
